## Graph Databases and Ontologies: Definitions and Relationships
Graph databases are data storage systems designed to store instance data and relationships, often used to implement ontologies (Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/semanticweb/comments/fpumms/whats_the_difference_between_an_ontology_and_a/#fln3iij). Ontologies are formally defined representations of knowledge that set out concepts and relationships within a domain, typically represented as graph models with nodes as concepts/classes and edges as relationships (Source: https://graph.build/resources/ontology). They serve as semantic schemata in semantic repositories like GraphDB, facilitating automated reasoning by embedding essential relationships between concepts directly into the ontology (Source: GraphDB 11.0 documentation). Ontologies define axioms that constrain and describe the relationships and properties of classes, which are not typically stored as instance data in graph databases (Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/semanticweb/comments/fpumms/whats_the_difference_between_an_ontology_and_a/#fln593m).

Ontologies differ from graph models in that ontologies define formal vocabularies and relationships using OWL and RDF, while graph models represent relationships between entities using nodes and edges for visualization and analysis (Source: https://graph.build/resources/ontology). The Web Ontology Language (OWL) extends RDF and RDFS by providing powerful ontology modeling capabilities, including consistency checks, satisfiability checks, and classification of instances (Source: GraphDB 11.0 documentation). OWL supports identity equivalence and difference through properties like sameAs, differentFrom, equivalentClass, and equivalentProperty, enhancing semantic precision (Source: GraphDB 11.0 documentation).

## Security Risks and Challenges in Graph Databases and Ontologies
Graph-based databases prioritize performance and flexibility but face challenges in secure design and access control due to technology-specific differences (Source: ). Existing secure NoSQL database design approaches mostly address security at the implementation stage, lacking higher abstraction level considerations (Source: ). This gap is addressed by a proposed framework that is the first technology-agnostic approach to designing secure graph-based databases, raising the abstraction level by using ontologies (Source: ).

Ontologies are used to simultaneously model database and security requirements, enabling integrated design of data protection and security policies (Source: ). The framework supports ontology reasoning to verify the consistency of security rules, helping to detect conflicts or gaps in security policies (Source: ). This approach was demonstrated through a case study involving hospital data access control, showing practical applicability in healthcare scenarios (Source: ).

The framework facilitates quick migration of security rules to different underlying database technologies by deriving specific security measures for each technology, allowing database designers to focus on protecting data and security requirements without dealing with implementation details, thus improving design efficiency (Source: ).

## Ontology Governance and Management
Enterprise-scale knowledge graphs require ontology development, maintenance, and governance including version control, quality assurance, usage monitoring, community engagement, and integration with other systems to ensure accuracy and relevance over time (Source: https://graph.build/resources/ontology). Ontology governance involves policies, procedures, ownership, stewardship, and quality control distinct from ontology management, which focuses on technical aspects like storage and editing; governance ensures alignment with organizational objectives (Source: https://graph.build/resources/ontology).

## Regulatory and Compliance Information
[정보 부족] There is no specific information related to legal frameworks, compliance standards, or data governance regulations for graph databases or ontologies in the provided content.

## Tools and Technologies Supporting Ontologies and Graph Databases
GraphDB is a semantic repository that supports ontologies as semantic schemata, enabling automated reasoning and facilitating ontology integration via an import function in the GraphDB Workbench interface (Source: GraphDB 11.0 documentation). It provides tutorials, video modules, and community support through Stack Overflow tagged 'graphdb' for technical questions (Source: GraphDB 11.0 documentation).

Protege software is used to create ontologies and guide the transformation of data into RDF files, supporting serialization formats such as RDF/XML and Turtle, which are common for OWL ontologies (Source: Reddit content). JSON-LD is a newer serialization format compatible with OWL ontologies, allowing direct reading into Protege as OWL objects (Source: Reddit content).

Graph query languages such as Cypher, Gremlin, SPARQL, and GraphQL enable querying of graph data based on patterns of nodes and edges, supporting complex queries and analytics in graph databases (Source: https://graph.build/resources/ontology, https://enterprise-knowledge.com/whats-the-difference-between-an-ontology-and-a-knowledge-graph/).

## Summary
Graph databases and ontologies are closely related but distinct: ontologies provide formal, reusable conceptual frameworks defining classes, relationships, and properties, while graph databases store instance data and relationships. Security risks in graph databases arise from technology-specific differences and lack of high-level security design, which can be addressed by ontology-based, technology-agnostic frameworks that integrate data and security modeling. Ontology governance is essential for maintaining accuracy and alignment with organizational goals. Tools like GraphDB and Protege support ontology creation, integration, and querying. However, specific regulatory and compliance information related to graph databases and ontologies is not available in the provided content.
