## Introduction to South Korea's AI Regulatory Landscape
South Korea has taken a significant step in AI governance by enacting the Basic Act on Artificial Intelligence and Creation of a Trust Base, commonly referred to as the AI Basic Act, which was signed into law on January 21, 2025, and is set to be enforced starting January 22, 2026. This legislation marks South Korea as the second country globally, after the European Union, to establish a comprehensive legal framework specifically governing artificial intelligence. The Act aims to balance the promotion of AI innovation with the protection of individual rights, safety, and ethical standards, thereby fostering public trust in AI technologies.

## Scope and Definitions under the AI Basic Act
The AI Basic Act defines artificial intelligence as the electronic implementation of human intellectual capabilities such as learning, reasoning, perception, judgment, and language comprehension. It applies extraterritorially to AI activities that impact South Korea’s domestic market or users, including foreign AI developers and operators without a physical presence in the country, provided they meet certain user or revenue thresholds. The law excludes AI developed or deployed exclusively for national defense or security purposes.

The Act categorizes AI systems into four main groups: all covered AI systems, high-impact (or high-risk) AI systems, generative AI systems, and AI systems with models exceeding specific computational power thresholds. High-impact AI systems are those that pose significant risks to human life, safety, or fundamental rights and are used in critical sectors such as healthcare, energy, nuclear safety, biometric data analysis, public decision-making, transportation, and education evaluation.

Generative AI is explicitly regulated, requiring providers to notify users in advance about AI usage and to label AI-generated content clearly, especially when outputs are difficult to distinguish from reality. However, some leniency is provided for artistic or creative works to avoid disrupting user experience.

## Regulatory Requirements and Compliance Obligations
The AI Basic Act imposes several key obligations on AI developers and operators. For all covered AI systems, businesses must conduct AI risk assessments and may request the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) to verify their AI system’s risk status. Operators of high-impact AI systems must implement comprehensive risk management plans, provide explainability of AI-generated results including decision criteria and training data overview, establish user protection measures, maintain human oversight, and keep detailed documentation demonstrating safety and reliability.

Transparency is a cornerstone of the Act. Organizations must notify users when high-impact or generative AI is used and clearly label AI-generated content. This ensures users are aware when they are interacting with AI systems or consuming AI-produced outputs.

For AI systems exceeding computational learning capacity thresholds, similar risk management and reporting obligations apply. These systems must have ongoing protocols to identify, assess, and mitigate risks throughout the AI lifecycle, with findings reported to MSIT.

Foreign AI providers meeting user or revenue thresholds but lacking a physical presence in South Korea are required to designate a domestic representative responsible for compliance management, safety reporting, and facilitating regulatory processes. Failure to comply with this requirement can result in administrative fines up to KRW 30 million (approximately USD 21,000).

## Enforcement and Penalties
The Ministry of Science and ICT holds regulatory authority to investigate violations of the AI Basic Act, including conducting on-site inspections and compelling data submissions. The Ministry can issue corrective orders to halt non-compliant AI practices. Penalties for non-compliance include administrative fines up to KRW 30 million for failures such as neglecting user notification, not designating a domestic representative, or ignoring suspension and correction orders.

Compared to the European Union’s AI Act, South Korea’s penalties are moderate, and the regulatory approach is more innovation-friendly, emphasizing post-market oversight rather than stringent ex-ante risk mitigation. The Act does not ban any AI use cases outright but allows for future enforcement decrees to impose suspensions or prohibitions if necessary.

## Institutional Framework and Governance
The AI Basic Act establishes several new public bodies to oversee AI governance and safety research, including the National Artificial Intelligence Commission, the National Artificial Intelligence Policy Center, and the Artificial Intelligence Safety Research Institute. These entities are tasked with guiding policy, resolving major AI issues, conducting safety research, and promoting international cooperation.

The Act mandates the government to develop a Basic AI Plan every three years, outlining policy direction, talent development, ethics, investment, fairness, and societal impact considerations. This plan aims to enhance South Korea’s national competitiveness in AI while ensuring ethical standards and public trust.

## Industry and Market Implications
South Korea’s AI regulatory framework reflects a global trend toward stricter AI governance, signaling to businesses that leveraging AI requires alignment with evolving legal and ethical standards. The Act supports AI innovation by promoting AI data centers, funding projects for AI training data production and distribution, encouraging technological standardization, and facilitating participation by SMEs and startups.

The law’s extraterritorial scope means that international AI companies operating in or targeting the South Korean market must closely monitor compliance requirements. The Ministry of Science and ICT is expected to release subordinate regulations in 2025, providing detailed guidelines for implementation. Public consultations with industry stakeholders are anticipated during this process.

## Challenges and Civil Society Perspectives
Despite the legislative progress, South Korean civil society has expressed concerns that the current AI bill prioritizes industry growth over robust regulatory safeguards. Key risks identified include privacy invasion, discriminatory decision-making, lack of accountability due to AI opacity, and enhanced surveillance capabilities threatening democracy and social equity.

Past incidents, such as the penalization of the Lee Luda chatbot for hate speech and fines imposed on major tech companies like Kakao and Naver for algorithmic manipulation, highlight the need for effective AI oversight. Civil society groups advocate for stronger human rights protections, transparency, risk assessment, and remedies for AI-related harms.

## Practical Recommendations for Organizations
Organizations operating AI systems in South Korea should proactively assess their AI portfolios to identify high-impact and generative AI usage. They must conduct thorough risk assessments, implement risk management frameworks, and document mitigation strategies to comply with the Act. Transparency measures should include clear user notifications and labeling of AI-generated content.

Establishing governance structures with designated compliance officers or domestic representatives is critical, especially for foreign entities. Organizations should monitor regulatory updates from the Ministry of Science and ICT, including forthcoming Presidential Decrees and the Basic AI Plan, to stay abreast of evolving requirements.

Technology solutions such as OneTrust’s Data & AI Governance platform and Securiti’s AI Command Center can assist organizations in managing AI risks, ensuring compliance, and implementing ethical AI practices at scale.

## Conclusion
South Korea’s AI Basic Act represents a comprehensive and balanced approach to AI regulation, combining innovation promotion with responsible deployment. Its extraterritorial reach, focus on high-impact and generative AI, and establishment of governance institutions position South Korea as a global leader in trustworthy AI. Businesses leveraging AI in the South Korean market must align their operations with these evolving legal and ethical standards to minimize compliance risks and uphold responsible AI use.
