## Construction Industry Pain Points Relevant to Safety AI
The construction industry faces significant operational challenges that impact safety and project success. Communication issues are a major pain point, including miscommunication among multiple stakeholders such as owners, architects, engineers, and contractors. The lack of collaboration tools and reliance on paper-based or manual processes lead to fragmented data and delays. There is also a lack of real-time visibility into project progress due to siloed systems and spreadsheets, which hampers early issue detection, productivity tracking, and resource allocation. Safety challenges include failure to enforce protocols, inadequate worker training, communication gaps caused by language barriers and signage, and lack of oversight, all of which increase accident risks and potential OSHA fines.

Insufficient collaboration among architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers causes costly mistakes, redundant work, and delays. Centralized communication systems and clear workflows are essential to mitigate these issues. Inaccurate reporting arises from manual data entry, inconsistent data formats, and human errors, leading to poor decision-making and mistrust. Legacy systems like spreadsheets dominate scheduling and budgeting but are error-prone and lack real-time collaboration, with cultural resistance to adopting new technology posing a significant barrier. The construction sector also suffers from a significant lack of standardization, with no unified processes or standards, leading to inconsistent practices across departments and poor communication due to varied tools and reliance on paper notes, which reduces data reliability and usefulness.

## Industry Context and Market Dynamics
The construction industry is characterized by low barriers to entry, resulting in a saturated market with intense competition and shrinking profit margins typically between 2-8%. Labor productivity has remained stagnant over the last 50 years, with studies showing that 63% of labor time on mega-projects is spent on non-productive activities such as waiting and traveling. The sector faces a critical human resource shortage, exemplified by the UK where an aging workforce and insufficient new entrants have led to a 213.4% increase in vacancies in Q3 2020 but a 53.9% decline in applications per vacancy, causing increased recruitment costs and inflated salaries.

Budget overruns are common, with only one in three projects meeting 10% of their original budget in recent years. Large projects like airports and hospitals can exceed budgets by $400–700 million, partly due to inaccurate bidding and insufficient owner oversight. Contracts often contain disclaimer clauses that unfairly allocate risks to contractors, damaging trust and collaboration and increasing project costs. The industry’s low investment in technology—only 1.5% of value-added compared to 3.3% in manufacturing—combined with short-term financial pressures, hinders long-term sustainability and innovation efforts.
