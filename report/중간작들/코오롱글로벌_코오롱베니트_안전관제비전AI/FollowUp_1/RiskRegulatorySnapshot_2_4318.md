## Overview of South Korea's AI Regulatory Landscape and Market Entry Barriers

As of mid-2024, South Korea did not have specific laws or statutory rules directly regulating artificial intelligence (AI). However, the National Assembly had proposed the Act on Promotion of the AI Industry and Framework for Establishing Trustworthy AI (commonly referred to as the 'AI Act'), aiming to consolidate seven AI-related bills introduced since 2022 into a unified legal framework. This legislation sought to promote the AI industry while protecting users through stringent notice and certification requirements. Despite these efforts, the 21st National Assembly adjourned in May 2024 without passing the AI Act, leaving it under review by the 22nd Assembly and creating regulatory uncertainty for market entrants.

## Fragmented and Evolving Legal Environment

South Korea’s AI regulatory environment is characterized by a patchwork of amendments to existing laws impacting AI use and development. These include the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection, the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), the Fair Hiring Procedure Act, the Content Industry Promotion Act, the Copyright Act, and the Public Official Election Act. For example, amendments to the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization require notification to the Korean Communications Commission when providing AI-based recommendation services and broaden the definition of 'information and communication service provider' to include AI technology users. PIPA amendments empower the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) to request information if personal data is leaked by an AI algorithm, while the Fair Hiring Procedure Act mandates notice to prospective employees when AI is used in hiring. These overlapping and evolving regulations contribute to compliance complexity, posing significant market entry barriers.

## The AI Act and Its Principles

The proposed AI Act defines artificial intelligence as the electronic implementation of human intellectual abilities such as learning, reasoning, perception, judgment, and language comprehension. It introduces a guiding principle of 'allow first, regulate later' to foster AI technology development. The Act classifies AI applications impacting human life and safety as 'high-risk AI' and outlines measures to ensure their reliability. It also establishes a legal foundation for AI ethical principles and proposes support measures for innovative AI companies, including the development of an AI Basic Plan and formation of an AI Committee supervised by the Prime Minister.

High-risk AI areas under the Act include sectors such as energy, healthcare, medical devices, nuclear facilities, biometric information in criminal investigations, AI used for judgment or evaluation affecting individual rights (e.g., recruitment, loan screening), transportation including autonomous driving, and AI used by government or public institutions affecting the public. The Act’s risk-based approach emphasizes safety, reliability, transparency, accountability, and ethics.

## Governmental Regulatory Bodies and Enforcement

Multiple government bodies regulate AI-related activities in South Korea. The Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) oversees policy and strategic direction; the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) regulates AI in communications and media; the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) governs data protection; the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ensures fair business practices; and the Ministry of Health and Welfare supervises AI in healthcare. Notably, prior to the AI Framework Act’s enforcement, no specific enforcement powers or penalties existed for AI under South Korean law, with enforcement governed by related non-AI legislation.

## The AI Framework Act: A Comprehensive Legal Milestone

On January 21, 2025, South Korea enacted the Framework Act on Artificial Intelligence Development and Establishment of a Foundation for Trustworthiness (AI Framework Act), marking the first comprehensive AI legislation in the Asia-Pacific region. Enforcement is set to begin on January 22, 2026. This Act applies extraterritorially to AI activities impacting South Korea’s domestic market or users, including foreign companies without a physical presence, except for AI used exclusively for national defense or security.

The Act adopts a risk-based regulatory approach focusing on 'high-impact AI' systems in critical sectors such as healthcare, energy, nuclear operations, biometric data analysis, public decision-making, and education. These systems significantly affect human life, safety, or basic rights and are subject to stricter oversight. Generative AI is specifically regulated, requiring transparency obligations including mandatory labeling of AI-generated content, especially for outputs difficult to distinguish from reality, while allowing some flexibility for artistic expression.

AI business operators are categorized as 'AI Development Business Operators' (developers) and 'AI Utilization Business Operators' (deployers), with obligations applying to both. High-impact AI providers must establish and operate risk management plans, provide explanations of AI-generated results within technical limits, implement user protection measures, ensure human oversight, and preserve documentation demonstrating safety and reliability measures. The Act encourages impact assessments for high-impact AI systems, incentivizing government agencies to prioritize AI products that have undergone such assessments in public procurement, though these assessments are not mandatory.

## Compliance Requirements and Market Entry Challenges

The AI Framework Act requires businesses to notify users when high-impact or generative AI is used and to clearly label AI-generated content to ensure transparency. Organizations must implement risk management systems throughout the AI lifecycle, including impact assessments on fundamental rights and documentation of safety measures. Human oversight must be maintained to mitigate risks and ensure ethical operation. Violations can result in administrative fines up to KRW 30 million (approximately USD 20,870) and potential imprisonment, with enforcement details provided by MSIT.

Foreign AI providers exceeding certain user number or revenue thresholds must appoint a domestic representative responsible for compliance and communication with MSIT, enhancing accountability of foreign entities. This requirement introduces operational complexities and may necessitate local partnerships or presence for foreign companies, representing a significant market entry barrier.

## Data Privacy and Intellectual Property Considerations

South Korea’s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), effective since August 2020, is the primary regulation governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, emphasizing consent, transparency, and security. Amendments to PIPA and related guidelines by PIPC address AI-specific privacy concerns, including data processing standards across AI lifecycle stages and the introduction of a 'privacy safe zone' system for secure AI development and testing. PIPC also operates a regulatory sandbox and pre-adequacy assessment system to assist businesses in complying with PIPA in AI services.

Intellectual property challenges include copyright issues in AI training data, particularly regarding web scraping and the applicability of fair use, which remains legally unsettled. Amendments to the Copyright Act are under review to allow text and data mining (TDM) for AI training under specified conditions without explicit copyright holder permission. South Korea does not currently recognize AI-generated works as copyrightable unless human creativity is involved in modifying or arranging the output.

## Regulatory Complexity and Dual-Layer Constraints

South Korea’s regulatory framework combines a 'positive regulation' system requiring explicit permission for business activities with pervasive informal 'shadow regulations,' creating a dual-layer constraint that stifles innovation in AI and other emerging technologies. This system forces businesses to assume risk when engaging in activities not explicitly permitted by law, contrasting with more permissive 'negative regulation' systems like that of the U.S. Shadow regulations manifest as administrative guidance and informal communications that extend regulatory control beyond formal laws, creating significant uncertainty and barriers for innovative businesses.

## Strategic Implications for Market Entrants

The fragmented regulatory environment, overlapping roles between MSIT and PIPC, and evolving legislation create compliance challenges for AI businesses entering South Korea. The AI Framework Act’s emphasis on ethical AI, transparency, and public trust aligns with global trends but requires careful navigation of new obligations, including risk management, user notification, explanation duties, and local representation.

The Act also signals government commitment to supporting AI innovation through funding for AI data centers, talent development, and standardization efforts, suggesting opportunities for collaboration and growth. However, the operational complexities and compliance costs, especially for foreign companies, constitute significant market entry barriers.

## Conclusion

South Korea’s AI regulatory landscape is rapidly evolving from a fragmented patchwork of amendments and proposals to a comprehensive, risk-based legal framework embodied in the AI Framework Act. While this legislation positions South Korea as a global leader in trustworthy AI governance, it introduces substantial compliance requirements and operational challenges for market entrants. Companies seeking to enter the South Korean AI market must proactively assess their AI systems for high-impact classification, implement robust risk management and transparency measures, designate local representatives, and closely monitor regulatory developments to ensure readiness for enforcement commencing in January 2026. Navigating this complex environment demands strategic planning to balance compliance with innovation and competitive positioning.
