## Measuring the Impact of Enterprise Knowledge Assistants (EKAs)
Enterprise Knowledge Assistants (EKAs) are AI-powered tools that enhance workplace efficiency by providing real-time, contextually relevant information, significantly reducing the time employees spend searching for knowledge. According to a McKinsey & Company survey, employees spend an average of 1.8 hours daily searching for relevant knowledge, highlighting the productivity drain that EKAs aim to mitigate. The implementation of EKAs is not just about technology adoption; it requires a structured approach to measure their real-world impact through specific metrics. Key metrics for evaluating the ROI of EKAs include search accuracy, time saved in information retrieval, reduction in training costs, customer satisfaction, and overall financial impact.

## Evaluating Search Accuracy and Time Savings
Search accuracy is critical; it is measured using precision, recall, F1 score, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to ensure that the information retrieved is relevant and timely. A case study showed that after implementing a RAG-powered EKA, a global enterprise improved precision from 0.69 to 0.92 and reduced ticket resolution time by 40%, demonstrating the direct impact on operational efficiency. Time saved in information retrieval is a direct ROI factor, with one case showing a drop in average search time from 9 minutes to 47 seconds per ticket, translating to over 2,200 agent hours saved in a quarter. Furthermore, reduction in training and onboarding costs is another significant metric; one company reported a 40% decrease in formal training hours and a reduction in time-to-productivity from 3.5 weeks to 2.1 weeks after EKA deployment.

## Customer Satisfaction and Financial Impact
Customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores can improve significantly with the use of EKAs; one e-commerce company saw an 11-point increase in CSAT after implementing a RAG-powered assistant, which also improved first-contact resolution rates by 22%. Financial impact metrics include cost savings from reduced manual errors and faster service delivery, with one telecom provider saving over 15,000 agent hours and achieving a 3.8% boost in customer retention, directly linked to revenue growth.

## The Open RAG Eval Framework
The Open RAG Eval framework was launched on April 8, 2025, to provide a scientific method for measuring the performance of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in enterprises. Developed by Vectara in collaboration with Professor Jimmy Lin from the University of Waterloo, the framework aims to address the critical blind spot of objectively measuring RAG system effectiveness. The framework transforms subjective evaluations into a rigorous methodology that assesses retrieval accuracy, generation quality, and hallucination rates in RAG deployments. Open RAG Eval evaluates RAG systems using two major metric categories: retrieval metrics and generation metrics, allowing for systematic identification of optimization needs.

## Key Metrics for RAG Evaluation
Key metrics evaluated by the framework include hallucination detection, which measures the presence of fabricated information; citation accuracy, quantifying how well citations are supported by source documents; auto nugget, assessing the presence of essential information nuggets; and UMBRELA, a holistic method for benchmarking retrieval performance. The nugget-based evaluation approach breaks responses into essential facts, measuring how effectively a system captures these nuggets, thus enhancing the evaluation process. The framework automates the evaluation process using large language models (LLMs), which previously required manual, labor-intensive efforts, marking a significant technical innovation.

## Distinctiveness of Open RAG Eval
Vectara's previous contributions to the open-source community include the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), which has been downloaded over 3.5 million times and serves as a standard for hallucination detection. The Open RAG Eval framework is distinct from other evaluation frameworks, such as Hugging Face's Yourbench and Galileo's Agentic Evaluations, as it focuses specifically on the RAG pipeline rather than just LLM outputs. The framework allows organizations to establish baseline scores for their existing RAG systems, enabling targeted configuration changes and measurement of resulting improvements, thus promoting a data-driven optimization approach. Future versions of Open RAG Eval may incorporate cost metrics to help organizations balance performance against operational expenses, further enhancing its utility for enterprises.
