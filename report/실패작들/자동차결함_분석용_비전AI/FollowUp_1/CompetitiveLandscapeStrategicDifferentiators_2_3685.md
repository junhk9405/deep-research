## Overview of AI in Automotive Defect Analysis and Quality Management
A comprehensive systematic review published in 2025 in the journal Sensors highlights the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in quality defect detection and management within the automotive industry, particularly under the paradigms of Industry 4.0 and 5.0. The review categorizes AI applications into three main groups: Quality Management (QM), Zero-Defect Manufacturing (ZDM), and Perceived Quality Framework (PQF). These frameworks collectively address quality planning, control, assurance, and improvement, leveraging AI techniques such as deep learning, artificial neural networks, and principal component analysis (PCA) to enhance defect detection accuracy, automate processes, and enable predictive maintenance.

Within QM, AI-driven demand forecasting using neural networks achieves the highest accuracy, while machine learning models like random forests and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) improve inspection reliability. Deep learning models have demonstrated a 98% true positive rate in surface defect detection, and autonomous quality management systems have successfully reduced rejection rates and associated costs. ZDM integrates AI for defect detection, prediction, repair, and prevention, with AIoT frameworks achieving perfect accuracy in anomaly detection on rotating machinery and PCA-ANN combinations effectively classifying welding defects with high precision. Fault detection employs semi-supervised learning, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and classifiers such as support vector machines (SVM) and random forests, often exceeding 90% diagnostic accuracy across components like gears, brakes, HVAC systems, and fuel cells.

AI-driven repair strategies incorporate additive manufacturing optimization and Industry 5.0 human-machine collaboration technologies, including cobots and digital twins, to enhance sustainable repair and restoration processes. Prevention-level AI applications utilize hierarchical decision-making systems like DRACO to proactively reduce defects in automotive coatings by combining quality prediction and inspection. The PQF leverages AI to assess multi-sensory quality attributes—visual, tactile, auditory, and olfactory—that influence customer satisfaction, employing big data and PCA for dimensionality reduction to predict paint structure quality.
