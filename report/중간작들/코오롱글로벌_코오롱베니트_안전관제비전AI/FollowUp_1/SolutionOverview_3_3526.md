## Overview of Kolon Benit and Its AI Ecosystem
Kolon Benit is a South Korean IT company specializing in advanced IT solutions and future technologies, operating under the larger Kolon Group umbrella. Established in 1990, the company has evolved over 33 years to become a mature and sizable IT innovator with reported sales of 428.5 billion KRW as of December 2021 and a workforce of 508 employees by the end of 2022. Kolon Benit’s business is segmented into three main divisions: Future Technologies, IT Distribution, and Enterprise IT Service, each targeting different facets of IT solutions and services. The company emphasizes Smart Convergence services, integrating IT with other industries to create innovative solutions for future markets. Its strategic focus on AI, big data, cloud computing, and digital transformation (DX) aligns with global technology trends, positioning it as a leading technology enabler for digital innovation across manufacturing, finance, fashion, construction, and public sectors.

Kolon Benit operates a broad partner network exceeding 1,000 companies and has established an AI-specific support system to facilitate AI business cooperation and joint opportunities. The company’s AI Alliance, launched on June 19, 2024, at Lotte Hotel World in Seoul, is a collaborative ecosystem comprising 53 AI specialist companies, including notable partners such as Lotte Novate, Kyobo DTS, Saltlux, and Eastsoft. This alliance aims to accelerate AI technology adoption and commercialization by leveraging each member’s expertise alongside Kolon Benit’s extensive IT infrastructure and distribution experience spanning over 30 years. The AI Alliance supports its members through structured programs like the Prepackage program for productizing solutions, the AI Adoption Incubating Program for customers, and the Boost Pack campaign to promote AI commercialization. The alliance also provides consortium formation, proof-of-concept (PoC/BMT) environments, demonstrations via the AI Solution Center, consulting, and comprehensive training in technical, sales, and marketing domains.

## Kolon Benit’s AI Safety Solution Scope and Industrial Applications
While explicit references to a dedicated "safety AI solution scope" are not directly stated in the available information, Kolon Benit’s strategic focus on future technologies and smart convergence strongly implies involvement in AI-driven safety solutions within its technology portfolio. This inference is supported by several key initiatives and partnerships that highlight Kolon Benit’s role in integrating AI with safety-critical industrial environments.

A prominent example is the collaboration involving Kolon Global (a Kolon Group affiliate), Sejong Telecom, and Hulan, which signed a business agreement on July 15, 2024, to introduce Korea’s first core-shared 5G specialized network model at construction sites. This pioneering model enables real-time connection between a 5G main center and multiple construction sites, facilitating large-scale data transmission and real-time monitoring. The 5G network supports high-quality on-site video analysis and large-scale AI CCTV installations, enhancing safety incident prevention through real-time AI analysis of CCTV video data. This initiative, part of the national '5G B2B service activation' project hosted by the Ministry of Science and ICT and the Korea Intelligent Information Society Agency (NIA), demonstrates government-backed strategic importance. Kolon Global plans to apply this 5G specialized network model to a 5.2 million square meter construction site for Merck’s bio project, showcasing scalability and industrial applicability. The integration of AI-driven video analytics with 5G connectivity positions Kolon Global—and by extension, Kolon Benit—at the forefront of smart construction safety technology innovation in Korea.

Additionally, Kolon Global’s establishment of an integrated control center in 2022, which connects CCTVs across all domestic sites for real-time monitoring and safety accident prevention, further underscores the group’s commitment to leveraging AI and network technologies for enhanced safety management. The 5G specialized network model is expected to improve technical security and reduce costs associated with construction site safety management, offering both operational and financial benefits. This collaboration aims to significantly elevate construction site safety levels and is anticipated to become a best practice model for effective disaster prevention in the construction industry.

## AI Technology and Innovation within Kolon Benit’s Ecosystem
Kolon Benit’s AI Alliance includes partners like Solugate, a leading voice AI specialist that signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Kolon Benit on November 25, 2024. Solugate’s patented AI learning method and on-premises installation solutions enhance AI deployment in industrial environments, emphasizing data security and real-time processing needs. Solugate’s voice AI meeting minutes solution, Solunote, was recognized as a government innovation best practice after exceeding 3,800 uses within 100 days, highlighting significant market demand for AI-powered voice transcription in government and industrial sectors. Solugate is expanding its business scope to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by launching Solunote Lite, a voice AI meeting minutes solution for PCs and laptops, scheduled for December 2024. This expansion reflects Kolon Benit’s strategic approach to broadening AI technology adoption beyond large enterprises.

Kolon Benit’s AI Alliance acts as a facilitator to overcome challenges companies face with high AI investment costs and difficulty generating real business opportunities. CEO Kang Yi-gu emphasized this role during the AI Alliance Connect 2024 event, which featured 53 companies and seminars by 24 companies sharing business models, references, and AI solution architectures. The alliance’s collaboration with global technology vendors such as Microsoft, IBM, Dell Technologies, and Red Hat as sponsors highlights strong international endorsement and cooperation.
