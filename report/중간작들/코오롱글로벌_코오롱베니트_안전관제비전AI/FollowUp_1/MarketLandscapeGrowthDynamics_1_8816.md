## Overview of South Korea's AI Regulatory Landscape
South Korea currently lacks specific laws or regulations directly governing artificial intelligence (AI). However, the National Assembly has been actively working on consolidating AI-related legislative efforts. A significant milestone is the proposed AI Act titled 'Act on Promotion of the AI Industry and Framework for Establishing Trustworthy AI,' which merges seven AI-related bills introduced since 2022. Although the 21st National Assembly adjourned in May 2024 without passing this Act, it remains under review by the 22nd National Assembly as of June 2024. This legislative initiative aims to foster AI industry growth while ensuring user protection through a secure ecosystem enforced by stringent notice and certification requirements.

## The AI Basic Act: South Korea's Comprehensive AI Framework
On January 21, 2025, South Korea enacted the Basic Act on Artificial Intelligence and Creation of a Trust Base (commonly referred to as the AI Basic Act), marking it as the first comprehensive AI legislation in Asia and the second globally after the European Union (EU). The Act will come into force on January 22, 2026, providing organizations approximately one year to prepare for compliance. It consists of six sections and 43 articles, outlining detailed regulatory requirements for AI development and deployment within South Korea.

The AI Basic Act defines AI broadly as the electronic implementation of human intellectual abilities such as learning, reasoning, perception, judgment, and language comprehension. It introduces a risk-based regulatory approach focusing on 'high-impact AI' systems—those significantly affecting human life, safety, or fundamental rights. High-impact AI sectors include energy, healthcare, medical devices, nuclear facilities, biometric information in criminal investigations, AI used in recruitment, loan screening, transportation (including autonomous driving), government public decision-making, and education evaluation.

## Key Principles and Obligations Under the AI Basic Act
The Act emphasizes several core principles: safety, reliability, transparency, and accountability. Organizations providing AI products or services must ensure transparency by clearly informing users when outputs—including visual media such as videos and images—are AI-generated. While artistic creations have some leniency, disclosure of AI involvement remains mandatory.

Safety obligations require organizations to identify, assess, and mitigate risks throughout the AI lifecycle. They must establish a risk management system capable of monitoring and responding to AI incidents, with proof of compliance submitted to the Minister of Science and ICT (MSIT). The Act mandates human oversight features in AI systems to allow monitoring and intervention, mitigating risks associated with automated decision-making.

The Act also applies extraterritorially to organizations outside South Korea conducting AI-related business within the South Korean market. Such organizations must designate a domestic representative if they lack a local address and meet specified user or financial thresholds. This domestic representative is responsible for submitting evidence of risk management, confirming whether AI products or services qualify as high-impact, and ensuring compliance with additional safety measures.

## Regulatory Scope and Definitions
The AI Basic Act covers AI developers (those who create AI systems) and AI operators (those who integrate AI into products or services), as well as government entities. It excludes AI developed or deployed exclusively for national defense or security purposes, as designated by Presidential Decree.

The Act categorizes AI systems into four groups: all covered AI systems, high-impact AI systems, generative AI systems, and AI systems with models exceeding certain computational power thresholds (to be defined by future Presidential Decrees). Generative AI is explicitly regulated, requiring providers to notify users of AI usage and label AI-generated content, especially when outputs are difficult to distinguish from reality. Artistic expressions receive some flexibility in labeling requirements.

## High-Impact AI: Enhanced Requirements
Providers and deployers of high-impact AI must implement comprehensive risk management plans, including explanations of AI decision criteria and training data where technically feasible. They must enforce user protection measures, maintain human supervision, and retain documentation proving system safety and reliability. Impact assessments evaluating effects on fundamental rights are mandatory before deployment, with government agencies prioritizing AI systems that have undergone such assessments.

## Enforcement and Penalties
Enforcement authority resides with the MSIT, which can investigate suspected violations, conduct on-site inspections, compel data submission, and issue corrective or suspension orders. Non-compliance with notification, labeling, domestic representative designation, or suspension orders can result in administrative fines up to 30 million Korean won (approximately USD 21,000). The Act adopts a moderate enforcement approach compared to other global AI regulations.

## Supporting Infrastructure and Governance
The Act establishes several new entities to oversee AI governance and safety, including the National Artificial Intelligence Commission, the National Artificial Intelligence Policy Center, and the Artificial Intelligence Safety Research Institute. It mandates the development of a national AI Basic Plan every three years to promote AI industry competitiveness, talent development, ethics, investment, fairness, international cooperation, and societal impact management.

The legislation also supports small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and startups to foster AI innovation, promotes AI data centers to build national AI infrastructure, and emphasizes attracting and developing AI professionals to sustain South Korea’s AI ecosystem growth.

## Related Legislative Amendments and Sector-Specific Regulations
Several existing laws are being amended to address AI-related issues. For example, the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization requires notification to the Korean Communications Commission when providing AI-based recommendation services. Amendments to the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) empower the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) to request information if personal data is leaked by an AI algorithm.

The Fair Hiring Procedure Act proposes requiring companies to notify prospective employees when AI is used in hiring processes. The Content Industry Promotion Act mandates disclosure when content is generated using AI technology. Amendments to the Copyright Act aim to clarify copyright infringement boundaries and permissible use of copyrighted works in AI automated information analysis. The Public Official Election Act prohibits AI use to manipulate polls with false information or restrict commentary on election results for electioneering purposes.

## Data Protection and Privacy Considerations
The PIPC plays a de facto regulatory role over AI involving personal data, creating a dual regulatory environment alongside MSIT. In August 2023, PIPC announced a policy titled 'The safe use of personal information in the AI era,' balancing AI industry stimulation with privacy risk minimization. This policy covers comprehensive data processing standards across AI lifecycle stages and introduces a 'privacy safe zone' system for secure AI development and testing.

PIPC has initiated a regulatory sandbox and a pre-adequacy assessment system to facilitate cooperative compliance strategies for AI services under PIPA. Guidelines for anonymization of unstructured data were issued in February 2024 to support AI development, with further guidelines planned.

## Intellectual Property Challenges
South Korea faces intellectual property (IP) challenges related to AI, including IP protection in AI training, infringement by AI outputs, and IP protection of AI-generated works. Web scraping for AI training raises copyright concerns, as the Copyright Act does not explicitly permit use of copyrighted materials for AI training, and the applicability of fair use is debated. An amendment proposing text and data mining exceptions for AI training is under review.

Currently, AI-generated works are not recognized as copyrightable if created solely by AI. However, human creative contributions to AI outputs may be eligible for copyright protection, as clarified in a December 2023 guide by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Copyright Commission.

## Comparison with International AI Regulatory Frameworks
South Korea’s AI regulatory approach balances fostering AI industry growth with ensuring transparency, safety, and accountability. It contrasts with China’s strict national security-focused framework and Singapore’s flexible, industry-led guidelines. Compared to the EU AI Act, South Korea’s AI Basic Act has a narrower definition of high-risk AI, does not ban any AI use cases, and imposes lower financial penalties.

The Act’s extraterritorial application and moderate enforcement reflect a pragmatic approach to regulation, aiming to support innovation while managing risks. South Korea’s legislation positions the country as a regional leader in AI governance, providing a potential model for other Asian countries such as Japan, China, and the UK, which are still debating AI legislation projected for 2025.

## Implementation and Compliance Recommendations
Organizations operating in or targeting the South Korean market should conduct preliminary evaluations of their AI products and services to determine if they fall under high-impact or generative AI classifications. They should begin implementing compliance measures, including establishing risk management frameworks, transparency protocols, and appointing domestic representatives if required.

Monitoring ongoing regulatory developments, including forthcoming Presidential Decrees that will clarify computational thresholds, revenue and user criteria for domestic representatives, and detailed definitions of high-impact AI, is essential. Organizations are also advised to align with international AI regulatory trends, such as the EU AI Act, and consider adopting AI data management standards like ISO 42001 and ISO 9001.

## Conclusion
South Korea’s AI Basic Act represents a significant advancement in AI governance, emphasizing transparency, safety, ethics, and accountability while fostering AI industry growth. Its comprehensive scope, extraterritorial reach, and balanced regulatory approach position South Korea as a global leader in AI regulation. Organizations leveraging AI technologies must proactively adapt to these evolving legal requirements to ensure compliance and maintain competitive advantage in the South Korean market.
