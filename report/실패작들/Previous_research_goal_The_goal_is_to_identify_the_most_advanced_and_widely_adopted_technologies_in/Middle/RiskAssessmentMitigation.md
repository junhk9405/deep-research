South Korea has established a robust and multi-layered cybersecurity framework to address the unique risks posed by the increasing integration of IoT and cloud technologies in smart factories. At the core of this framework are the Information Security Management System (ISMS) and its privacy-focused extension, ISMS-P, which set comprehensive standards for information security and personal data protection. These standards are not merely guidelines but are legally enforced, particularly for organizations designated as Critical Information Infrastructure (CII). Manufacturing facilities that fall under the CII category are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and must adhere to stricter security controls, reflecting the sector’s strategic importance and vulnerability to cyber threats.

The South Korean government, through agencies such as the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSICT) and the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), plays a pivotal role in orchestrating national cybersecurity efforts. KISA, for instance, is instrumental in workforce development, training approximately 1,500 cybersecurity professionals annually to ensure a steady pipeline of skilled experts. The agency also offers IoT security certifications, which are increasingly vital as the proliferation of connected devices expands the attack surface within smart factories. To foster innovation and practical security solutions, KISA operates living labs where 5G and IoT security technologies are tested in controlled, real-world environments, enabling rapid identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities before they can be exploited in operational settings.

The implementation of cybersecurity in South Korean smart factories follows a phased and adaptive approach. In the initial stages, factories focus on establishing basic ICT security measures, such as firewalls and antivirus solutions. As digital transformation progresses and factories adopt more advanced technologies like IoT devices, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and cloud-based platforms, the security posture evolves accordingly. This evolution includes the deployment of network segmentation to isolate critical systems, real-time monitoring for anomalous activities, the adoption of secure communication protocols, and the hardening of firmware and device-level security. Employee training is also emphasized, recognizing that human error remains a significant vector for cyber incidents.

Best practices in the sector are comprehensive and reflect global standards while being tailored to the specific context of South Korean manufacturing. Asset inventory and patch management are foundational, ensuring that all devices are accounted for and vulnerabilities are promptly addressed. Network security is reinforced through the use of firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), and micro-segmentation, which limits lateral movement by attackers within the network. Access controls are stringent, employing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and the principle of least privilege to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. Data protection is achieved through robust encryption, both at rest and in transit, safeguarding sensitive information from interception or exfiltration. Incident response planning is a critical component, with predefined protocols enabling rapid containment and recovery in the event of a breach. Additionally, supply chain security is rigorously vetted, acknowledging that third-party vendors can introduce significant risks if not properly managed.

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation further enhances the security posture of smart factories. AI-driven threat detection systems are capable of identifying and responding to sophisticated attacks in real time, reducing the window of opportunity for adversaries. In environments utilizing digital twins—virtual replicas of physical systems—security is prioritized by isolating these environments from production networks, thereby preventing the cross-contamination of threats and ensuring operational continuity.

The threat landscape for manufacturing in South Korea is particularly acute. In 2024, advanced persistent threats (APTs) accounted for 19% of breaches in the sector, while ransomware was responsible for 52% of malware attacks. These statistics underscore the sector’s attractiveness to both financially motivated and state-sponsored actors. In response, South Korean smart factories employ continuous monitoring, participate in threat intelligence sharing initiatives, maintain regular data backups, and enforce robust access controls. These measures are designed not only to prevent incidents but also to ensure rapid recovery and business resilience in the face of successful attacks.

At a strategic level, the national approach to smart factory cybersecurity is characterized by a commitment to proactive, layered defense. This involves close collaboration between government and industry, with policies and technical standards continuously updated to keep pace with technological advancements and emerging threats. The strategy explicitly recognizes the need for resilience against a broad spectrum of risks, including APTs, ransomware, hacktivism, and data theft. By fostering a culture of continuous improvement and adaptation, South Korea aims to maintain the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of its smart manufacturing infrastructure, thereby supporting both economic growth and national security in an increasingly digitalized industrial landscape.
