## South Korea AI in Video Surveillance Market
The global AI in video surveillance market was valued at USD 3.90 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 12.46 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 21.3% from 2025 to 2030. Asia Pacific holds the largest share, driven by rapid urbanization and the presence of key software providers. South Korea is among the leading countries in Asia Pacific adopting AI and IoT technologies for advanced video surveillance, with increasing demand for IP security solutions.

Government and public facilities represent the largest market share, deploying AI surveillance systems in law enforcement buildings, transportation hubs, healthcare, and schools. Smart city initiatives are a major driver, with Asia expected to account for 50% of the global population and 60% of economic growth by 2030, fueling demand for AI surveillance in urban management. Edge-based deployment is expected to dominate due to customization capabilities, integration with legacy systems, and privacy advantages by processing data locally. Cloud-based video surveillance systems are gaining traction for scalability, remote access, and lower infrastructure costs.

Key technologies driving the video surveillance market include machine learning, deep learning (notably convolutional neural networks), generative AI, computer vision, and natural language processing. Challenges include high installation and operational costs, system complexity, interoperability issues with legacy systems, and regulatory compliance related to data privacy. Data breach risks necessitate encryption, anonymization, and transparency to comply with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.

South Korea’s AI surveillance market benefits from smart home technology adoption, integrating AI surveillance with IoT devices like smart locks and doorbell cameras for enhanced residential security. Leading companies include Hanwha Vision Co., Ltd. (South Korea), alongside global players such as Hangzhou Hikvision and Dahua Technology (China), Motorola Solutions (US), and SenseTime (Hong Kong).

## Regulatory and Legal Framework
South Korea enacted the Framework Act on the Development of AI and the Creation of a Trustworthiness Foundation on January 21, 2025, with enforcement starting January 22, 2026. This act is the first comprehensive AI legislation in the Asia-Pacific region and applies extraterritorially to AI activities impacting South Korea’s domestic market or users, including foreign companies without physical presence, except for AI used exclusively for national defense or security.

The Act defines 'high-impact AI' as systems posing significant risks to human life, safety, or basic rights, used in critical sectors such as healthcare, energy, nuclear operations, biometric data analysis, public decision-making, and education. Obligations focus primarily on these high-impact AI systems, requiring risk management plans, explanation of AI-generated results, user protection measures, human oversight, and documentation of safety measures.

Generative AI systems are specifically regulated with mandatory transparency and labeling requirements, including notifying users when content is AI-generated, especially for outputs difficult to distinguish from reality. The Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) is empowered with investigative and enforcement authority, including on-site inspections and administrative fines up to KRW 30 million (approx. USD 21,000) for non-compliance.

The Act supports AI innovation by promoting government-led initiatives for AI training data production, management, and distribution, and by establishing AI Data Centers with administrative and financial support to facilitate AI model training accessible to SMEs and startups. It distinguishes between AI Development Business Operators (developers) and AI Utilization Business Operators (deployers), with transparency and compliance obligations applying to both. Foreign AI providers exceeding certain user number or revenue thresholds must appoint a domestic representative responsible for compliance and communication with MSIT.

South Korea’s AI Framework Act contrasts with the EU AI Act by having a simplified risk categorization, absence of prohibited AI practices, lower financial penalties, and stronger government support for AI development and standardization. The Act is part of a broader AI governance landscape involving the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC), which regulates personal data processing in AI, creating a dual regulatory environment requiring compliance with both MSIT and PIPC.

## Market Ecosystem and Competitive Landscape
South Korea’s AI ecosystem is robust, supported by a strong R&D infrastructure and active collaboration between domestic firms and global organizations. The country is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, producing high-end semiconductor devices essential for AI development, particularly logic and memory chips.
