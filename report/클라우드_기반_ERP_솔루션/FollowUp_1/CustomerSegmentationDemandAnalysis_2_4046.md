## Introduction to Cloud ERP Adoption in Korea
Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have become a pivotal technology for businesses seeking to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and support digital transformation. In Korea, the adoption of cloud ERP is influenced by a complex interplay of technological, organizational, and environmental factors. Recent empirical studies and systematic literature reviews provide a comprehensive understanding of these factors, highlighting the unique market dynamics and decision-making criteria relevant to Korean enterprises.

## Market Trends and Growth
Globally, the cloud ERP market is projected to surpass USD 178 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.1%. This growth is driven by a significant migration from traditional on-premise ERP systems to cloud-based solutions, motivated by cost savings, scalability, and enhanced productivity. In Korea, this trend is mirrored by increasing interest in cloud ERP, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large enterprises (LEs), with a notable preference for established vendors like SAP and Oracle.

## Critical Success Factors in Cloud ERP Adoption
A systematic literature review analyzing 73 publications from 2011 to 2020 identified 16 critical success factors (CSFs) influencing cloud ERP adoption. Among these, security of the system emerged as the most frequently cited factor, underscoring the paramount importance of data protection in cloud environments. Senior management support is the second most critical factor, emphasizing the need for executive commitment and resource allocation.

Customization and add-on capabilities are also vital, as organizations seek ERP systems that meet most of their needs out-of-the-box to avoid costly and risky modifications. Ease of integration with other cloud services is essential for optimizing business processes and ensuring data consistency across functional modules. User education and training significantly impact adoption success, with approaches like 'train the trainers' helping build internal expertise. Additionally, employees' ICT skills, particularly cloud computing proficiency, are critical; lack of such skills has been identified as a major obstacle in European enterprises and is likely relevant in Korea as well.

## Technological and Organizational Influences
Research applying the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) and Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) frameworks reveals that innovation characteristics such as perceived relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability influence adoption decisions. In Korea, relative advantage—defined as the perceived superiority of cloud ERP over existing systems—strongly drives adoption due to benefits like cost savings, improved communication, and flexible scalability.

Organizational culture plays a critical role; companies with responsive, flexible, and open cultures, coupled with strong senior management support, are more likely to adopt cloud ERP. Financial advantages, including cost savings and return on investment, further motivate adoption. Environmental factors such as competitive pressure, regulatory environment, and external support also significantly influence decisions. Notably, Korea's recent regulatory reforms, including the 'Three Data Acts,' have facilitated cloud ERP adoption by reducing legal and compliance barriers.

## Security and Vendor Lock-in Concerns
While security concerns are traditionally a major barrier to cloud ERP adoption, recent Korean studies indicate that data security issues were not statistically significant in influencing adoption intention, suggesting improved trust in cloud ERP providers' security measures. However, vendor lock-in remains a significant resistance factor. The difficulties and costs associated with switching providers discourage adoption despite potential dissatisfaction, highlighting the need for strategies to mitigate lock-in risks.

Key security sub-issues include risks of data leakage and loss due to multiple data copies on portable devices, risks from third-party server hosting leading to loss of control, and the importance of robust data backup and recovery capabilities. Cloud ERP vendors are expected to build trust by ensuring data security, availability, and responsive support.

## Usability and Integration Challenges
Usability challenges include potential disruption of Internet service causing system paralysis, resistance to change from stakeholders losing control over processes, and the need for intuitive user interfaces to reduce training time and increase adoption. The advantage of data accessibility from any device or location is a strong positive factor.

Integration capabilities are critical; ERP systems must seamlessly connect with existing tools to reduce manual tasks, improve data accuracy, and unify operational views. Limitations in customization due to multi-tenant cloud environments can pose challenges, but advances in configurability have mitigated some concerns.

## Vendor Selection Criteria and Market Landscape
Selecting the right cloud ERP vendor is crucial for business growth, operational efficiency, and long-term success. Clear vendor selection criteria should be established upfront, focusing on industry fit, company size, scalability, flexibility, and integration capabilities. Industry-specific ERP solutions and scalability are essential; vendors with experience in the client’s industry and solutions tailored to company size provide better support for current and future growth.

Comprehensive market research is vital, including evaluating vendor reputation, product range, and market presence. Customer reviews, case studies from similar industries, and peer recommendations offer practical insights beyond technical specifications. Vendor demos should be tailored to specific business challenges and involve key stakeholders to assess fit and capability gaps.

Top cloud ERP vendors for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in 2025 include Oracle NetSuite, SAP Business ByDesign, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Acumatica, Infor CloudSuite, Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, and IFS Cloud. Each offers unique strengths, such as Oracle NetSuite’s transparent subscription pricing and real-time analytics, SAP’s scalability and compliance tools, and Microsoft Dynamics’ seamless integration with Microsoft Office 365 and AI-powered analytics.

Pricing models vary widely, including subscription-based, per-user, and modular approaches. Total cost of ownership must consider implementation, training, data migration, and long-term ROI. Reliable customer support with multiple channels and 24/7 availability is essential to minimize downtime and ensure smooth adoption.

## Organizational and Cultural Factors in Korean Context
A 2020 study surveying 148 Korean companies found that organizational culture, regulatory environment, relative advantage, trialability, and vendor lock-in significantly influence cloud ERP adoption intention. Organizational culture, characterized by responsiveness, flexibility, and openness, combined with strong senior management support, is particularly critical.

Trialability—the ability to experiment with cloud ERP on a limited basis before full adoption—positively affects adoption intention, suggesting that vendors should offer demos or trial programs. Interestingly, factors such as ICT skills, complexity, observability, data security, and customization did not show statistically significant influence in this Korean sample, indicating possible maturity in these areas or cultural differences compared to other countries.

## Transaction Cost Economics Perspective
From a transaction cost economics viewpoint, studies focusing on manufacturing firms in East Asia highlight that uncertainty and switching costs increase perceived risks associated with cloud ERP adoption, which negatively affect adoption intention. Conversely, perceived switching benefits encourage adoption. This framework provides a data-backed approach for firms in Korea to assess cloud ERP vendor choice by balancing perceived risks against benefits.

## Benefits and Challenges of Cloud ERP Adoption
Cloud ERP offers numerous benefits, including cost savings on hardware and software licensing, reduced IT support needs, faster system deployment, and enhanced security by storing data in the cloud rather than locally. Businesses report high return on investment, with 83% meeting ROI expectations within one year.

However, challenges remain, such as integration difficulties with legacy on-premise systems, complex data migration, hidden costs related to subscriptions and training, organizational resistance to change, and vendor lock-in risks. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive planning, strong leadership, and effective change management.

## Future Trends and Recommendations
Future trends in cloud ERP include increasing integration of artificial intelligence for predictive analytics and automation, enhanced security measures complying with global standards like GDPR and HIPAA, and a greater focus on SMBs through simplified onboarding and modular pricing.
