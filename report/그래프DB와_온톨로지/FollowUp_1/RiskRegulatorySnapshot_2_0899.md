## Ontology and Graph Databases Overview
An ontology is a formally defined representation of knowledge that sets out concepts and relationships within a domain, typically represented using a graph model with nodes as concepts/classes and edges as relationships. Ontologies provide a standardized way to represent and share knowledge, improving communication and collaboration across organizations and systems, and are used in fields like healthcare, finance, and engineering. They are often represented using OWL (Web Ontology Language) based on RDF (Resource Description Framework), supporting multiple serialization formats including XML, JSON, and Turtle. Ontologies differ from schemas in that they provide a flexible, extensible conceptual framework for a domain, while schemas define rigid, static data structures for databases to ensure data integrity (Sources: https://graph.build/resources/ontology, https://enterprise-knowledge.com/whats-the-difference-between-an-ontology-and-a-knowledge-graph/).

Ontologies serve as the logical graph model for semantic knowledge graphs, which are graph models that use ontologies to enable integration, reasoning, and presentation of heterogeneous data from multiple sources. Knowledge graphs represent data as a web of interconnected entities and relationships, enabling new insights and connections not apparent in tabular data. The fundamental relationship is ontology plus data equals knowledge graph. Query languages such as SPARQL are used to query knowledge graphs, supporting inferencing to discover implicit connections (Sources: https://graph.build/resources/ontology, https://enterprise-knowledge.com/whats-the-difference-between-an-ontology-and-a-knowledge-graph/).

## Ontology Governance
Ontology governance involves formalized processes, policies, and frameworks guiding the creation, management, evolution, and use of ontologies within an organization to ensure consistency and adherence to standards. It is essential for quality assurance, scalability, collaboration, compliance, and security in managing ontologies across an enterprise. Governance includes establishing policies, procedures, ownership, stewardship, and quality control to keep the ontology accurate, consistent, and aligned with organizational objectives. It differs from ontology management, which focuses on technical aspects like storage, retrieval, version control, and integration, whereas governance encompasses broader process and policy frameworks for sustainable ontology lifecycle management (Sources: https://graph.build/resources/ontology, https://blog.metaphacts.com/a-guide-to-ontology-governance-in-metaphactory).

Best practices in ontology governance include collaborative ontology creation, review, versioning, and lifecycle management supported by tools such as metaphactory, which provides editorial workflows, role-based permissions, provenance tracking, and integration with systems like Git for version control. Roles such as Owners and Authors manage editing and publishing rights, and ontologies are locked during review to prevent changes. User-level benefits include improved collaboration, transparency, clear responsibilities, and explicit change management with rollback capabilities. Future enhancements aim to add notifications and dashboards for quality control. Non-technical users can contribute via intuitive interfaces, enabling domain experts to participate without prior modeling knowledge (Source: https://blog.metaphacts.com/a-guide-to-ontology-governance-in-metaphactory).

Metadata governance, closely related to ontology governance, emphasizes maintaining metadata and taxonomies as living tools that evolve with content. It involves defined roles and responsibilities, clear policies and procedures, and metrics to measure growth and change. Simplicity in governance processes is critical to avoid delays and stagnation. Differentiating major and minor changes streamlines approvals. Dedicated ownership, possibly part-time and rotated, is necessary. The RACI framework is recommended for clarifying roles and communication. Regular communication with stakeholders maintains engagement and relevance. Automation and technology integration enable centralized management, enforce access controls, standardize workflows, and reduce manual burdens, supporting scalability and sustainability. Examples include system flags for cleanup, auto-categorization, metadata suggestions, and user-submitted suggestions via integrated workflows. Effective governance saves costs and rework by preventing redesigns of stale models and ensuring continuous alignment with organizational needs (Source: https://enterprise-knowledge.com/best-practices-for-successful-metadata-governance/).

## Ontology Governance in Graph Databases
A technology-agnostic ontology-based framework has been proposed for the secure design of graph-based NoSQL databases, raising the abstraction level to model database structure and security requirements simultaneously. This framework allows database designers to focus on data protection without worrying about implementation details and facilitates rapid migration of security rules across different underlying database technologies. Ontology reasoning is employed to check the consistency of security rules, reducing ambiguity and enabling automated reasoning about data and security policies.

The framework is integrated into the TITAN platform, which manages the lifecycle of data science workflows and uses the BIGOWL ontology to semantically describe NoSQL database structures and security policies. The ontology extends BIGOWL by adding classes such as Database, SecurityRule, GraphsDatabase, Node, Relationship, Field, Privilege, Role, and User, with 24 classes, 12 object properties, 7 data properties, and 112 constraint axioms defined. Security policies are modeled using a metamodel that supports role-based access control (RBAC) with privileges like Create, Read, Update, and Delete, applicable to graph elements (nodes, relationships) and their fields.

The ontology development followed the Ontology 101 methodology, including domain determination, reuse of existing ontologies, term enumeration, class hierarchy definition, property definition, facet constraints, and instance creation from metamodels. The knowledge graph is created by transforming metamodels specified in XMI into RDF triples, stored in a Stardog RDF repository with reasoning capabilities, and queried via SPARQL endpoints. An API wraps SPARQL queries to facilitate extraction of semantic data for generating security policies in specific graph database implementations like Neo4J and OrientDB. The framework supports automatic generation of security policy implementations for these databases, handling differences such as Neo4J requiring one policy per privilege and OrientDB allowing grouped privileges and conditional policies.

A healthcare domain case study models patients, doctors, diseases, treatments, and admission staff with fine-grained security policies defined per role, demonstrating the framework's applicability. The ontology and framework comply with FAIR principles for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability, scoring highest marks in 17 out of 24 tests using the FOOPS! validator. The framework enables delaying the selection of the specific graph database technology until design requirements are clear, supporting implementation independence. Ontology supports transitive properties such as role hierarchies, enabling reasoning to infer role descendants and security rule inheritance. Future work includes extending the framework to other NoSQL database types beyond graph databases and enhancing reasoning capabilities to detect potential information leaks and design errors before implementation (Source: Abstract and sections from ontology-based framework paper).
