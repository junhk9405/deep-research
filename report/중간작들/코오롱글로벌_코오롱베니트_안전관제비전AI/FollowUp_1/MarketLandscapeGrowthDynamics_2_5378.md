## Health and Happiness System (HHS): Smart Safety Helmet Innovation
Health and Happiness System (HHS), a Korean startup founded in 2016 in Ulsan, has developed a smart safety helmet integrating AI and electroencephalogram (EEG) technology to monitor construction workers’ brain waves and vital signs in real time. Korea’s poor industrial safety record among OECD countries has driven innovations like HHS’s helmet to reduce work-related disasters.

The helmet uses AI-enhanced EEG sensors to monitor brain waves, ECG, and pulse, enabling on-site managers to track laborers’ health live. This is the first industry attempt to combine IT with EEG for real-time brain wave monitoring in industrial safety applications. Targeting primarily construction sites, the helmet aims to reduce accidents and improve worker safety and productivity through better risk management.

HHS has secured contracts with South Korean state-run corporations for nationwide distribution and is negotiating with major construction firms. The CEO, Han Hyung-seob, with a background in biomedical signal processing, was recognized by the Korean Intellectual Property Office for the helmet’s innovation. Supported by the Ulsan Economic Promotion Agency, HHS showcased the helmet at the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, receiving positive international interest. The Korea International Construction & Industrial Safety Expo serves as a key platform for promoting such safety technologies.
