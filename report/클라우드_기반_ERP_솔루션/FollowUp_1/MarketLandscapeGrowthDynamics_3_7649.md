## Definition and Evolution of ERP and Cloud ERP
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a comprehensive software system designed to integrate core business processes such as finance, human resources, manufacturing, supply chain, sales, and procurement into a unified platform that provides a single source of truth. Originating over a century ago from paper-based manufacturing scheduling systems, ERP evolved through computerized applications in the 1960s and matured into integrated systems by the 1990s, serving multiple industries. Initially deployed on-premises within client data centers, ERP systems have since transitioned to cloud-based models, fundamentally changing accessibility and management.

Cloud ERP, the most popular deployment model today, is enterprise resource planning software hosted and managed on cloud infrastructure by third-party providers. It is accessed on demand via web browsers or dedicated applications, typically under a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) subscription model. This shift eliminates the need for in-house IT infrastructure and reduces upfront costs, making ERP solutions accessible to smaller companies and enabling scalability, faster innovation, and easier integration.

## Core Components and Functional Scope of Cloud ERP
Cloud ERP systems consist of modular applications sharing a common database, allowing companies to select and scale modules such as finance, logistics, procurement, human resources, inventory, manufacturing, sales, customer relationship management (CRM), and supply chain management (SCM) according to their needs. These modules facilitate real-time data access and collaboration across departments and geographies, enhancing transparency, decision-making, and productivity.

Key functional areas include financial accounting, management accounting, human resources, manufacturing, order processing, project management, supplier relationship management (SRM), and contract management. Cloud ERP also supports industry-specific requirements, with manufacturers focusing on quality and inventory control, retailers on omnichannel integration and customer experience, utilities on asset management, and wholesalers on distribution efficiency.

## Deployment Models and Technical Architecture
Cloud ERP deployment models encompass public cloud (multi-tenant, cost-effective, limited customization), private cloud (single-tenant, higher security, customizable, higher cost), hybrid cloud (combining public and private clouds), and partner cloud models designed for groups of related companies. Service models include SaaS, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for custom application development, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering virtualized infrastructure with more control but increased management overhead.

Hosting is typically managed by ERP vendors on global data centers provided by major cloud providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Vendors handle servers, data storage, operating systems, security, and upgrades, offering subscription pricing based on user count, functional scope, or data volume. Cloud ERP systems provide high availability (often 99.999%), automatic upgrades during off-hours, and enterprise-grade security including encryption, multi-factor authentication, and compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.

## Market Landscape and Growth Trends in Korea and Globally
The global cloud ERP market was valued at approximately $43.91 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $65.89 billion by 2027, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.7%.
