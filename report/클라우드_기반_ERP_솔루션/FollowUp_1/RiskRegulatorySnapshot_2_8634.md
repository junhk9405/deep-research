## Cloud Security and Regulatory Environment for Cloud ERP in South Korea
Microsoft Azure became the first major global cloud service provider to receive South Korea's Cloud Security Assurance Program (CSAP) certification as of December 2024, enabling its use by public sector institutions. The CSAP certification, issued by the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), is divided into three tiers: High, Medium, and Low. Microsoft obtained the Low tier ('Ha'), which allows support for public systems that do not handle sensitive or private data. This tiered certification system, introduced in 2022, represents a strategic regulatory shift in South Korea, balancing national security concerns with the need to leverage global cloud technologies in public institutions. Previously, South Korea mandated physical separation of servers for public and private sector data, but the CSAP framework has eased these restrictions for compliant foreign cloud providers.

South Korea's stringent cloud security regulations stem from concerns about data security, privacy, sovereignty, and persistent cybersecurity threats, particularly from North Korea targeting government, private businesses, and critical infrastructure. Microsoft Azure holds over 100 global security certifications, including ISO 9001, SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, and domestic certifications such as Korea Information Security Management System (K-ISMS) and Financial Security Institute CSP safety assessments. AWS and Google Cloud are actively pursuing similar CSAP certifications; AWS achieved K-ISMS certification in South Korea in 2023 and currently holds 60% of the private cloud market share, while Microsoft holds approximately 24%, indicating a competitive landscape dominated by global hyperscalers with limited market share for local providers like Naver's NDrive and Solbox.

The CSAP certification milestone is significant for foreign cloud providers aiming to expand into South Korea's public sector, which was previously difficult due to strict regulatory barriers. Microsoft Korea's Public Sector Business Division emphasizes its commitment to meeting the high reliability demands of domestic public institutions and accelerating innovation through AI and cloud technologies. The competitive cloud ERP solution market in South Korea is shaped by hyperscalers' certifications and compliance, which directly impact their ability to serve public sector clients and influence overall market dynamics.
