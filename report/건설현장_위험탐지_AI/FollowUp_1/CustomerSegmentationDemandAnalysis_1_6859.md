Academic research highlights the use of advanced AI methods such as fuzzy hybrid methods (FHMs), Bayesian belief networks (BBNs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), and structural equation modeling (SEM) to address complexity and uncertainty in construction risk management. These methods enable modeling of risk interdependencies and uncertainty, which are critical in mega construction projects with high complexity.

Fuzzy logic helps handle vagueness in expert judgments, while BBNs model risk interdependencies and update probabilities with new information. Hybrid approaches combining these methods offer promising solutions to capture complexity-risk interdependencies and improve cost-risk assessment accuracy. However, challenges remain in computational complexity, reliance on subjective expert knowledge, and handling large variable sets.

## Future Trends and Strategic Recommendations
The future of AI in construction risk management points toward deeper integration with emerging technologies such as blockchain, digital twins, and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). AI-enabled digital twins will allow real-time infrastructure assessment, while AI-driven satellite and LiDAR monitoring will enhance large-scale infrastructure management. Predictive maintenance and autonomous equipment will further improve safety and operational efficiency.

To maximize the benefits of AI construction risk solutions, companies should adopt a phased implementation strategy that includes technology adoption, workforce training, and robust data governance policies.
