## Overview of Customer Segmentation in Chatbots
Chatbots automatically collect data from all users who interact with them, storing this information in a dedicated Users or Visitors section for segmentation and analysis. This data collection enables businesses to identify distinct customer segments based on user interactions, preferences, and behaviors, which can then be used to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement (Sources: provided content, https://www.chatbot.com/help/settings/segments/, https://www.londondaily.news/how-do-chatbots-enhance-customer-segmentation-efforts/).

## Segmentation Management via API
ChatBot platforms provide programmatic management of user segments through API endpoints. Users can list existing segments, which include properties such as segment ID, name, user count, and creation timestamp. New segments can be created by specifying a name, and users can be added to one or multiple segments in bulk. Segments can also be updated or deleted via API calls, with authentication required for all segment management operations. This API-driven approach facilitates dynamic and scalable segmentation management (Source: provided content).

## Segment Usage and Features
Segments serve multiple purposes including creating visitor lists for marketing campaigns and database management. Visitors can be added or removed from segments at any time, either manually in the Visitors section or automatically during chat interactions using dedicated bot flow actions. Segments can be exported as CSV files for external use, though only account owners and administrators have permissions to export or delete visitor data, ensuring controlled data management. Bot flows can leverage segment membership to send targeted messages, for example, filtering by email attributes (Source: https://www.chatbot.com/help/settings/segments/).

## Data-Driven Customer Profiling and Analytics
Chatbots collect rich data integrated into CRM systems, including user inquiries, feedback, and interaction history. This data supports the creation of detailed customer profiles segmented by buying patterns, preferences, behavior, and demographics. Advanced analytics techniques such as clustering algorithms and predictive modeling applied to chatbot data enable segmentation beyond traditional demographics, incorporating engagement levels and behavioral indicators. Continuous updating of segmentation based on real-time chatbot data allows businesses to remain agile and responsive to customer dynamics, maximizing marketing ROI (Source: https://www.londondaily.news/how-do-chatbots-enhance-customer-segmentation-efforts/, https://mailchimp.com/resources/ai-customer-segmentation/).

## AI and Behavioral Criteria in Segmentation
Artificial intelligence enhances customer segmentation by analyzing multiple data points including demographics, transactions, online interactions, browsing history, and sentiment analysis from social media. AI-powered segmentation enables dynamic, real-time updates and predictive segmentation forecasting future customer behavior and preferences. Behavioral modeling identifies indicators such as purchase intent or churn likelihood, while hyper-personalization delivers tailored messages based on granular data and contextual factors like time and location. These AI-driven approaches improve marketing efficiency and decision-making by automating large dataset analysis and providing actionable insights (Source: https://mailchimp.com/resources/ai-customer-segmentation/).

## Summary
Customer segmentation criteria in chatbots encompass a combination of user interaction data, behavioral patterns, demographic information, and AI-driven analytics. Segments are managed programmatically via APIs and can be dynamically updated during chatbot interactions. The integration of chatbot data with CRM and advanced analytics enables businesses to create detailed, actionable customer profiles for targeted marketing and improved customer experience.
