Viewing LLMs as graph neural networks offers new perspectives on their structure and capabilities, potentially resolving structural oddities and informing hybrid AI architectures (Source: Hackernoon article). Instruction fine-tuned LLMs now automate knowledge graph creation by extracting entities and relationships from text chunks using user-defined prompts, improving efficiency (Source: 1). NVIDIA provides open-source tools such as NeMo, NIM microservices, and cuGraph to build, fine-tune, and optimize scalable LLM-driven knowledge graph workflows (Source: 1).

## Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG)
GraphRAG is a growing variant of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that integrates knowledge graphs with LLMs to improve AI application reliability, reasoning capabilities, and reduce hallucinations (Sources: Hackernoon article, Microsoft Research Blog, MongoDB blog). It leverages knowledge graphs to represent relationships between entities, enabling joint modeling of entities and relationships during retrieval for better query intent understanding (Source: e1e902c504ed). GraphRAG outperforms baseline RAG methods in answering complex queries, providing detailed, provenance-backed answers, and enabling whole-dataset reasoning (Source: Microsoft Research Blog). It also offers enhanced explainability and transparency by visually representing document relationships through knowledge graphs (Source: MongoDB blog).

Variants of GraphRAG include ontology-grounded OG-RAG, cost-efficient KET-RAG, near-LLM accurate MiniRAG, multimodal mmGraphRAG, and others that enhance retrieval, reasoning, and efficiency (Source: Hackernoon article). NebulaGraph pioneered GraphRAG, supporting enterprise-specific knowledge graph applications with minimal effort and integration with LLM frameworks like Llama Index and LangChain (Source: e1e902c504ed).
