## Introduction to AI Safety and Strategic Importance in South Korea
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal element in the 21st-century digital power competition, influencing military capabilities, cybersecurity, and sociocultural domains. Early leadership in AI algorithms, chipsets, and large language models confers significant economic and strategic advantages. However, AI’s dual-use nature introduces complex security challenges, such as enhancing weapons automation, amplifying the scale and precision of cyberattacks, and accelerating the spread of disinformation. Real-world conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict, have demonstrated AI’s role in national security threats through AI-powered drones and automated target recognition systems. Google’s report of over 57 state-backed hacking groups employing AI for cyberattacks underscores the urgency of addressing AI security threats.

## South Korea’s Legislative and Institutional Framework for AI Safety
South Korea has taken significant legislative steps to govern AI safety and trustworthiness. The AI Basic Act, enacted on January 21, 2025, and effective from January 22, 2026, represents the first comprehensive AI legislation in the Asia-Pacific region. This Act aims to promote AI development while ensuring public trust through risk management and certification-based mechanisms. It applies extraterritorially to AI activities impacting South Korea’s domestic market, including foreign companies without physical presence, except for AI exclusively used for national defense or security.

The Act categorizes AI systems with significant impact on human life or rights as “high-impact” and imposes strict safety requirements on them. These include mandatory risk management plans, user protection measures, human oversight, and documentation of safety protocols. High-impact AI sectors encompass healthcare, energy, nuclear operations, biometric data analysis, public decision-making, and education. Generative AI is explicitly defined and subject to transparency and labeling requirements, ensuring users are notified when content is AI-generated.

South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) oversees enforcement, empowered with investigative authority and the ability to impose administrative fines up to KRW 30 million (~USD 21,000) for non-compliance. Foreign AI providers crossing user or revenue thresholds must appoint domestic representatives responsible for compliance. The Act also supports AI innovation by fostering AI data centers, funding training data projects, and encouraging technological standardization to aid SMEs and startups.

## AI Safety Institute and Collaborative Research Initiatives
In alignment with its legislative framework, South Korea officially launched the AI Safety Institute (AISI) on November 27, 2024, at the Pangyo Global R&D Center under MSIT. The institute operates within the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) and is structured to systematically address AI risks, including technological limitations, human misuse, and potential loss of control over AI systems. AISI serves as Korea’s central hub for AI safety research, fostering collaboration among industry, academia, and research organizations.

AISI is a member of the International Network of AI Safety Institutes, launched on November 21, 2024, which includes 10 countries, emphasizing South Korea’s commitment to global AI safety cooperation. The institute’s mission includes advancing risk assessment methodologies, developing policies and technologies to mitigate AI risks, and supporting Korean AI companies by reducing risk factors that affect their global competitiveness. The Korea AI Safety Consortium, formed through a Memorandum of Understanding signed by 24 leading organizations, promotes cooperation in AI safety policy research, evaluation, and R&D.

## International Cooperation and Global AI Safety Governance
South Korea’s AI safety efforts are embedded within a broader international context. The AI Seoul Summit in May 2024, cohosted by South Korea and the United Kingdom, reinforced AI safety as a core element of responsible AI innovation. Leaders from 10 countries and the European Union signed the Seoul Declaration, emphasizing enhanced international cooperation to develop human-centric, trustworthy AI.

The summit series, following the inaugural UK AI Safety Summit in 2023, represents a shift in global AI policy focus from ethics to concrete safety measures and regulatory frameworks for advanced AI models. The network of AI safety institutes aims to align research on machine learning standards, testing, and share information about AI models’ risks, capabilities, and limitations. South Korea actively participates in this network, positioning itself as a regional AI safety research hub.

## AI Safety Commitments and Industry Engagement
At the AI Seoul Summit, 20 organizations, including major global AI and technology companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, Samsung Electronics, and NVIDIA, agreed to voluntary Frontier AI Safety Commitments. These commitments focus on responsible development and deployment of frontier AI models—highly capable general-purpose AI systems matching or exceeding the most advanced models’ capabilities.

The commitments require organizations to identify, assess, and manage risks throughout the AI lifecycle, set explicit risk thresholds for severe risks, and refrain from developing or deploying models exceeding these thresholds if risks cannot be mitigated. They also emphasize internal accountability, transparency to external actors, and robust cybersecurity and insider threat safeguards to protect proprietary and unreleased model weights.

## Challenges and Gaps in South Korea’s AI Safety Monitoring Scope
Despite these advances, South Korea faces challenges in fully integrating AI safety within its national security framework. The AI Basic Act excludes AI used exclusively for national defense or security, and the AI Safety Research Institute’s limited staffing constrains its capacity to focus on defense-related AI risks. Unlike the EU AI Act, South Korea’s framework minimizes regulation for low-risk AI systems, which may still pose national security threats if misused.

Furthermore, South Korea’s lack of a robust AI security framework hampers allied technological cohesion, interoperability, and joint threat response, particularly with the United States and the United Kingdom, which have designated AI as a national security asset and implemented stringent AI security standards and export controls. US export control policies impact South Korea’s semiconductor exports and AI chip manufacturing, posing regulatory risks and supply chain challenges.

## Strategic Recommendations for Enhancing AI Safety Monitoring
To address these gaps, recommendations for South Korea include establishing clear legal and strategic frameworks for AI in defense, clarifying agency roles to reduce overlap, and creating a dedicated AI security institution with sufficient authority and resources. Enhancing technical capabilities in AI threat detection and cyberattack prediction is critical.

South Korea should actively participate in US- and UK-led AI safety assessment frameworks and global technical standards to ensure interoperability and safe integration of private-sector AI technologies into national security systems. Recognizing AI as a strategic asset essential to national defense requires a comprehensive national security perspective encompassing data, semiconductors, and cloud infrastructure, alongside increased public and institutional awareness of AI’s long-term strategic implications.

## Conclusion
South Korea’s AI safety monitoring solution scope encompasses a comprehensive legislative framework, institutional establishment of the AI Safety Institute, active international cooperation, and voluntary industry commitments. While significant progress has been made, particularly in governance and research collaboration, challenges remain in integrating AI safety within national defense and security domains. Addressing these challenges through strategic legal, institutional, and technical enhancements will be vital for South Korea to maintain its competitive edge and ensure the safe, trustworthy deployment of AI technologies in an increasingly complex global landscape.
