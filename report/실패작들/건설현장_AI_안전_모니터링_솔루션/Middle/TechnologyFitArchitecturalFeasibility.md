## Transformative Impact of AI on Construction Safety
The construction industry is undergoing a transformative shift with the integration of generative AI, significantly enhancing site safety and risk management as of mid-2024. Generative AI applications extend beyond content creation to include real-time monitoring of personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance, detection of near-miss collisions, predictive analysis, risk assessment, and automated safety reporting. These capabilities improve immediate site safety conditions and operational efficiency, enabling a proactive rather than reactive approach to Environmental Health and Safety (EHS).

AI systems analyze vast datasets to identify hidden risk patterns and predict potential hazards, allowing EHS professionals to forecast unsafe worker behaviors and site conditions. This shift from incident response to prevention is supported by real-time safety dashboards powered by AI, which provide continuous monitoring and predictive analytics of site conditions. Such dashboards facilitate informed project planning and execution with integrated safety considerations, redefining construction safety by enabling unprecedented proactive risk management and accident prevention capabilities.

## AI Technologies and Data Modalities in Construction Safety
Key AI technologies relevant to construction safety include Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for automating administrative and physical tasks, AI-enabled sensors for anomaly detection, Internet of Things (IoT) integration for device connectivity, and predictive analytics for data-driven safety strategies. AI-powered robotic automation handles hazardous tasks such as heavy lifting, reducing worker exposure to dangerous conditions and human error. AI vision technologies with facial recognition monitor worker fatigue indicators, such as yawning and eyelid drooping, helping prevent accidents related to decreased mental capacity during night shifts, where accident and injury rates significantly increase.

Wearable AI sensors, including smartwatches, monitor worker vitals and detect health anomalies in real-time, especially benefiting remote or lone workers by enabling early intervention. AI-powered sensors detect environmental anomalies like temperature changes, equipment malfunctions, and behavioral irregularities, providing early warnings to prevent accidents. AI-enhanced security systems combine 360-degree cameras, facial recognition, and IoT to create comprehensive surveillance networks that reduce theft, vandalism, and unauthorized access on nomadic construction sites.

AI applications in construction safety primarily leverage three data modalities: text (e.g., reports, logs), visual (e.g., images, videos), and audio (e.g., ambient sounds, machinery noise). These correspond to human sensory inputs and enable emulation of human perception for safety assessment. A comprehensive review of 153 papers reveals extensive use of AI techniques such as deep neural networks, object recognition, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for real-time monitoring, hazard detection, and information extraction. However, audio-based AI applications remain underexplored despite their potential to provide valuable safety insights, indicating a significant opportunity for future research.

## AI-Driven Real-Time Monitoring and Predictive Analytics
AI-powered video analytics use object recognition to detect unsafe worker behaviors such as hazardous proximity to heavy machinery, intrusion into restricted zones, PPE noncompliance, and absence of barricades, delivering real-time alerts to workers and supervisors. PPE noncompliance is a critical risk factor; workers without PPE are three times more likely to be injured, and 70%-80% of fall incidents are linked to lack of PPE usage. AI models using computer vision and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly the You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) architecture, autonomously detect PPE compliance from video feeds, enabling real-time, automated verification.

AI systems enhance safety compliance by distinguishing routine activities from potential risks, allowing prompt corrective actions that minimize accident rates. Real-time AI monitoring enables immediate intervention by site supervisors; for example, instant alerts are sent if AI detects improperly installed ceilings or missing protective gear. AI analyzes historical safety data—including accidents, near misses, and safety observations—to identify patterns and predict potential safety risks in future projects, improving risk assessment beyond manual methods.

Predictive analytics models incorporate diverse data inputs such as weather patterns, machinery telemetry, and worker schedules to forecast unsafe conditions and prevent accidents caused by equipment failure or extreme weather. This proactive approach potentially saves lives and reduces project delays. AI-driven safety solutions facilitate substantial cost savings, with businesses reporting annual savings exceeding £1 million by reducing safety-related shutdowns and downtime.
