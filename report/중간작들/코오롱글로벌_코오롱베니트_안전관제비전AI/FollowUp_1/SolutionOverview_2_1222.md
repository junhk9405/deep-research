## South Korea’s AI Regulatory Environment and Governance
South Korea enacted the Basic Act on Artificial Intelligence and Creation of a Trust Base on January 21, 2025, with enforcement starting January 22, 2026. This comprehensive AI governance framework emphasizes safety, transparency, and ethics. The Act broadly defines AI as electronic implementations of human intellectual capabilities including learning, reasoning, perception, and judgment, and specifically defines high-impact AI systems affecting human life, safety, or fundamental rights, such as those used in healthcare, hiring, loan screening, and biometric analysis. Generative AI and AI business operators are explicitly defined, providing clear governance scope for emerging AI technologies and operators. The law applies to all AI activities impacting the South Korean market, regardless of origin, with exceptions only for AI developed exclusively for national defense or security purposes. Key organizational obligations include notifying users when high-impact or generative AI is used, clearly labeling AI-generated content, mitigating risks throughout the AI lifecycle, establishing risk management systems, and maintaining human oversight. High-impact AI operators must conduct impact assessments on fundamental rights and document safety and reliability measures. Enforcement provisions include fines up to KRW 30 million (approximately USD 20,870) and potential imprisonment for violations, with detailed implementation plans to be issued by the Ministry of Science and ICT. Organizations are advised to assess their AI systems to identify high-impact AI usage, perform risk assessments, and document mitigation strategies to prepare for compliance. Transparency measures include clear labeling of AI-generated content and developing user communication strategies. Building a risk management framework with ongoing protocols and comprehensive documentation is critical for regulatory audits and compliance readiness. Strengthening governance involves designating responsible personnel or domestic representatives and considering autonomous AI ethics committees. Organizations should actively monitor regulatory updates from the Ministry of Science and ICT, including future decrees and the Basic AI Plan. OneTrust offers a Data & AI Governance solution designed to help organizations assess AI risks, ensure compliance, and implement ethical AI practices at scale, supporting preparation for South Korea’s new AI regulatory environment. This Act signals a global trend toward stricter AI regulations, requiring businesses leveraging AI to align operations with transparency, safety, and ethical standards to minimize compliance risks and foster trust.

## South Korea’s AI and Semiconductor Industry Landscape
South Korea is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, producing high-end semiconductor devices essential for AI development, particularly logic and memory chips, which are in high demand worldwide. In 2022, semiconductors accounted for nearly 19% of South Korea's total exports, making it the country's most significant export sector; approximately 60% of these chip exports, valued at $66 billion, were shipped to China. Between 2010 and 2021, South Korea ranked third globally in the number of AI patents filed and granted, with Samsung and LG responsible for 9% of all AI patents granted in the country during this period. Machine learning dominates South Korean AI patents, featuring in 77% of all AI patents over the past decade, aligning with global trends. South Korea also ranks second globally in AI patents related to energy management, education, and military applications. The AI investment ecosystem is nascent but growing rapidly, with private investments in Korean AI companies increasing almost every year since 2014, reaching $2.76 billion in 2021. Domestic investors are the primary financiers, participating in nearly 84% of investment transactions targeting Korean AI companies from 2010 to 2021, while foreign investors, especially from the U.S., have contributed to some of the largest deals. From 2010 to 2021, South Korean researchers published 68,404 AI-related papers, ranking 11th globally. The United States is South Korea's most significant AI research partner, followed by China, with 31% of AI-related papers by Korean authors coauthored internationally. South Korea produces more engineering graduates relative to its population than the United States, China, and India, with increasing numbers in AI-related fields, though demand for AI talent may soon exceed supply. There is a severe gender disparity in AI-related education; in 2021, only 12% of doctoral graduates in AI-related fields were women, posing risks to workforce diversity and capacity. Rising regional geopolitical tensions and demographic challenges may threaten South Korea's ability to sustain and expand its competitive advantages in AI development and deployment. South Korea's AI ecosystem strengths lie in hardware (semiconductors), patent production, and research output, but its investment ecosystem and talent pipeline face challenges that could impact future growth and competitiveness.
