## Construction Industry Safety Challenges and the Need for Innovation
Construction remains one of the most hazardous industries worldwide, accounting for over 20% of all worker deaths annually in the United States as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2024. The sector faces a fatality rate five times higher than other industries, with leading causes including falls (33.5%), struck-by objects (11.1%), electrocutions (8.5%), and caught-in-between accidents (5.5%). Non-fatal injury rates are also 71% higher than any other industry, underscoring the critical need for enhanced safety measures. Traditional safety methods rely heavily on lagging indicators such as incident reports and audits, which only identify problems after accidents occur, limiting proactive risk management. Additionally, manual monitoring of construction sites, including CCTV surveillance, is often inconsistent and insufficient, with approximately 80% of monitoring still done manually, and no human capable of effectively watching more than six screens simultaneously. Workers frequently admit to non-compliance with personal protective equipment (PPE) due to discomfort or unwillingness, further exacerbating safety risks.

## Emergence and Impact of Vision AI in Construction Safety
Vision AI technologies have emerged as transformative tools to address these challenges by shifting construction safety from reactive compliance to proactive risk prevention. Platforms like Visionify and viAct.ai leverage artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to provide continuous, 24/7 real-time monitoring of construction sites through multiple camera feeds and IoT sensors. These systems detect a wide range of hazards including PPE compliance (hard hats, safety vests, eyewear, gloves, fall protection, respiratory gear), unsafe worker behaviors (improper lifting, unsafe equipment use, unauthorized access), environmental risks (slip/fall hazards, fire/smoke, unstable structures, equipment malfunctions), and unauthorized personnel in restricted zones.

Vision AI platforms integrate seamlessly with existing CCTV infrastructure, environmental sensors, mobile devices, and site management systems, enabling scalable deployment without major infrastructure overhauls. For example, Visionify’s cloud-based SaaS model supports multi-site management and standardizes safety protocols across projects.
