## AI Vision Applications in Construction Safety Monitoring
The construction industry is highly risky, with workers exposed to heavy machinery, heights, and unpredictable environmental conditions, necessitating advanced safety monitoring solutions. The construction vertical is explicitly covered in the AI vision market segmentation, indicating targeted applications for safety monitoring and operational efficiency in construction sectors globally, including Korea. The construction industry accounts for about 7% of the global workforce but is responsible for 30% to 40% of occupational deaths in many countries, with South Korea having a notably high average mortality rate of 17.9 compared to the US (9.4) and China (5.3). AI and computer vision technologies enable real-time hazard detection on construction sites by identifying obstacles, unstable structures, and hazardous materials that may not be visible to humans. AI systems monitor worker behavior using sensors and computer vision to ensure compliance with safety protocols, such as maintaining safe distances and proper lifting techniques, reducing accident risks. Environmental monitoring by AI includes tracking dust, noise, and air quality to maintain safe working conditions and regulatory compliance, with real-time alerts for corrective actions. AI-powered personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance systems analyze visual data to verify workers wear helmets, gloves, and vests, instantly notifying managers of violations.

## Technical Advances in AI Safety Monitoring for Construction
Recent research on vision-based AI safety monitoring systems in construction highlights challenges such as false alarms caused by object misdetection and false detection, which reduce overall system performance and reliability. A proposed safety monitoring system integrates three modules: object detection using YOLOv8, rule compliance checking PPE like hard hats via coordinate correlation, and temporal analysis evaluating multiple frames over time to reduce false alarms. YOLOv8, introduced in 2023, outperforms previous versions in accuracy and small object detection, featuring a modified CSPDarknet53 backbone with C2f modules and an anchor-free detection paradigm, improving computational efficiency and detection precision. The temporal-analysis module uses a sliding window approach analyzing classification results over a time window and triggers alarms only if a threshold percentage of frames are unsafe, reducing false alarms by 2.03% on average in real-time tests. The dataset used for training includes 5903 images with classes such as person, hard hat, boots, vest, and robodog, augmented to improve robustness. The rule-compliance module uses bounding box coordinates to verify if a worker is wearing a hard hat, handling full and partial occlusions and classifying unsafe scenarios such as hard hats held in hand or misplaced. Evaluation metrics show scene classification accuracy of 95%. The system was experimentally validated on five test videos, demonstrating improved reliability and a reduction in false alarms, advancing safety management protocols in hazardous construction environments.
