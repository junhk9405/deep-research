## Challenges in Graph Database Security Design
Graph-based databases prioritize performance and flexibility but face challenges in security and access control design due to technology-specific differences. Existing secure NoSQL database design approaches mostly address security at the implementation stage, lacking higher abstraction level design for security and access control (Source: ).

## Ontology-Based Framework for Secure Graph Databases
A novel, technology-agnostic framework has been proposed for designing secure graph-based databases using ontologies to model database and security requirements simultaneously. This framework is supported by the TITAN framework, which facilitates handling both database and security aspects together. The ontology-based approach allows database designers to focus on protecting data and security without dealing with implementation details. It enables quick migration of security rules to different underlying database technologies by deriving specific security measures for each technology. Ontology reasoning is employed to verify the consistency of security rules within the design, enhancing reliability. The approach was demonstrated through a case study involving hospital data access control, showing its practical applicability in healthcare scenarios. This framework raises the abstraction level in secure database design, integrating security considerations early in the design process rather than post-implementation. The use of ontologies supports knowledge extraction and reasoning capabilities, which are critical for managing complex security policies in graph databases. The authors highlight that their approach facilitates simultaneous modeling of database and security requirements, which is not common in existing methods (Source: ).

## Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs and Ontologies
Cybersecurity knowledge graphs (CKGs) use graph-based data models to represent complex cybersecurity data from diverse sources, aiding in cyberthreat intelligence, situational awareness, attack path visualization, and data correlation. Formal knowledge representation in cybersecurity enables automated categorization of vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks, entity resolution, anomaly detection, and attack pattern matching, revealing correlations beyond human analyst capabilities. Common graph data models for cybersecurity knowledge graphs include RDF graphs, labeled property graphs, hypergraphs, and multigraphs, each with distinct semantics and capabilities. Prominent graph databases supporting these models include semantic graph databases like Allegrograph, Amazon Neptune, and GraphDB; property graph databases like Neo4j and TigerGraph; and multi-model databases like ArangoDB and JanusGraph. Not all graph data models support n-ary relations or data provenance, which are important for modeling communication networks and cyber-situational awareness; extensions to RDF exist to capture provenance. Cybersecurity knowledge graphs can model network infrastructure, autonomous systems, network information flow, cyberattack graphs, cyberthreat intelligence data, and ontologies representing cybersecurity concepts and properties. Knowledge organization systems such as MITRE ATT&CK, STIX, STUCCO, CoCoa, UCO, VulOntology, and SEPSES provide structured vocabularies and ontologies for cybersecurity knowledge graphs, facilitating automation and interoperability. Automated reasoning over cybersecurity knowledge graphs enables inference of new facts, detection of implicit relationships, attack graph construction, alert correlation, and defense strategy generation, improving cyber-situational awareness and response. Machine learning on cybersecurity knowledge graphs includes graph-based anomaly detection, graph neural networks for intrusion detection, relation extraction via deep learning, and reinforcement learning for malware analysis and mitigation. Visualization of cybersecurity knowledge graphs helps analysts explore aggregated log data, vulnerabilities, attack patterns, intrusion detection events, and attack trees, improving context and decision-making; 3D visualizations like DAEDALUS-VIZ address scalability issues. Data aggregation and fusion using cybersecurity knowledge graphs integrate diverse sources such as IDS, firewall logs, vulnerability scanners, and public datasets, enabling zero-day vulnerability mitigation, lateral movement detection, and decision support. CKGs facilitate federated queries across multiple data sources, enabling identification of vulnerabilities affecting specific software configurations and supporting automated patch management decisions. Graph-based intrusion detection systems aggregate large-scale network data for anomaly detection, and combining semantic knowledge graphs with machine learning supports collaborative defense against complex attacks like ransomware. CKGs contribute to standardizing cybersecurity terminology, enabling interoperability, automated processing, and knowledge discovery across heterogeneous data formats and sources (Source: ).

## Ontology Development for Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs
An ontology specifically designed for a cybersecurity knowledge graph database was developed to organize and integrate information from diverse structured and unstructured data sources within the cybersecurity domain. Developed as part of the STUCCO project, it integrates data from 13 structured sources and internal data such as netflows and IDS alerts to build a comprehensive cybersecurity information resource. The ontology includes 15 entity types and 115 properties, designed to represent all necessary fields from the integrated datasets, with a focus on usability for both human analysts and automated tools. Exploit entities are grouped under the more general 'Malware' entity due to difficulty distinguishing exploits from malware in available data sources. The ontology supports detailed contextual information, such as linking network flow entities back to the software processes that generated them, when such data is available from host-based systems. Address entities are decomposed into specific sub-components (e.g., IP, port) to facilitate more effective querying and aggregation of network-related data. The ontology is implemented using JSON-Schema, compatible with the GraphSON format used by the Titan graph database, enabling straightforward data validation and schema definition. The choice of JSON-Schema over OWL or RDFS limits automatic reasoning capabilities such as inferring new relationships, but this trade-off was acceptable given the current use cases. The ontology design was influenced by anticipated use cases including incident response by human users and automated intrusion detection systems, requiring alignment with users' mental models and provision of accurate, specific information. Previous work in cybersecurity ontologies and taxonomies, such as those focusing on vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE, NVD) and attacks (e.g., OWASP Top 10), informed the development of this ontology, though integration across different entity types remains a challenge. The ontology aims to address the lack of consensus and cross-referencing among malware naming and data from different antivirus vendors by providing a unified schema. Future work includes improving interoperability with standards like STIX to enhance data sharing and tool integration. The ontology supports integration of unstructured text data through entity and relation extraction guided by the ontology, despite challenges posed by ambiguous or incorrect terminology in cybersecurity texts. The research was sponsored by multiple government agencies, indicating broad interest in cybersecurity knowledge representation (Source: Developing an Ontology for Cyber Security Knowledge Graphs).

## Ontology-Based Attack Graphs and Dynamic Security Analysis
Attack graphs represent possible adversarial actions to attack a system and are used by cybersecurity experts for remediation and recovery planning. Logical attack graphs based on predicate logic define causality of adversarial actions. Networks and vulnerabilities are dynamic, necessitating continuous update of attack graphs. Enriching attack graph generation with semantic augmentation post-processing of predicates reflects real-time changes and attack evidences. This involves mapping attack graphs to monitoring alerts that confirm successful attack actions, allowing periodic updates of predicates. This approach enables verification of whether network or vulnerability changes lead attackers to initial goals or cause unforeseen damage beyond initial attack graphs. The methodology is illustrated in cyber-physical security affecting smart cities. Validation was performed using existing tools and ontologies. Enrichment of attack graphs with ontology allows semantic understanding of attack predicates, improving accuracy and relevance of security vulnerability assessments. The approach supports continuous monitoring and updating of attack graphs, critical given evolving network vulnerabilities and attack surfaces (Source: arXiv:2202.04016).

## Ontology and Attack Graphs in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) Security
A dynamic attack graph generation method for the IoV identifies and visually displays security risks caused by vulnerabilities in the IoV system. A network security ontology model for the IoV was developed, modeling security elements and their relationships across the cloud-channel-edge-terminal architecture. The ontology includes five main entity classes: assets, vulnerable components, vulnerabilities, attacks, and attackers, with detailed datatype and object properties defining their attributes and relationships. The attack graph generation uses Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules to represent causal relationships between vulnerabilities and attacks, enabling reasoning about multi-step attack paths. A dynamic attack graph generation algorithm incrementally updates the attack graph based on changes in network topology, connectivity, or node information, suitable for the rapidly changing IoV environment. The initial attack graph generation algorithm uses breadth-first search and forward chaining with the HermiT ontology reasoning engine to infer potential attack paths from instantiated security elements. Three types of inference rules are used: vulnerability existence inference, vulnerability exploitability inference, and network connectivity inference, to model the attack process and attacker capabilities. A typical attack scenario with 10 IoV-related vulnerabilities was presented, identifying four attack paths involving various attack methods exploiting multiple vulnerabilities to gain control over vehicle systems. The dynamic update of the attack graph was demonstrated by removing vulnerabilities after updates, showing the algorithm’s ability to timely reflect changes in IoV security posture. Experimental results show computational efficiency and scalability. This ontology and attack graph approach facilitates global risk management and active defense system construction for IoV by providing a unified and standardized expression of IoV security knowledge (Source: Frontiers in Energy Research).
