The SDK integrates with LLMs such as GPT and Gemini, enabling the creation and querying of knowledge graphs using the Cypher query language (Source: FalkorDB content). It supports multiple LLM providers including LiteLLM, OpenAI (recommended model: gpt-4o), Google (recommended model: gemini-2.0-flash), Azure-OpenAI, and Ollama (Source: FalkorDB/GraphRAG-SDK).

The SDK supports ontology creation either manually or automated from unstructured data sources such as URLs, with example code demonstrating ontology auto-detection using the gemini/gemini-2.0-flash model (Source: FalkorDB/GraphRAG-SDK). Knowledge Graph agents can be created from predefined ontologies and configured with custom prompts to tailor behavior, supporting five types of prompts including Cypher system instructions and Q&A prompts (Source: FalkorDB/GraphRAG-SDK). It supports multi-graph querying with APIs designed for cross-domain and hierarchical graph exploration, enabling complex retrieval tasks (Source: FalkorDB/GraphRAG-SDK).

The SDK includes a multi-agent orchestrator system where each agent specializes in a domain (e.g., restaurants, attractions) and the orchestrator manages agent usage and questioning to provide composite responses (Source: FalkorDB/GraphRAG-SDK). It supports various file formats for data ingestion including PDF, JSONL, CSV, HTML, TEXT, and URLs, facilitating flexible data integration (Source: FalkorDB/GraphRAG-SDK). The SDK is open-source, licensed under the MIT License, and actively maintained with example notebooks and demos to facilitate user onboarding (Source: FalkorDB/GraphRAG-SDK).

## Neo4j Overview and Comparison
Neo4j is a mature, general-purpose graph database with a large community, extensive ecosystem, and proven track record across industries such as finance, healthcare, and telecommunications (Source: FalkorDB content). It supports vector index and similarity search with cosine similarity and Euclidean distance metrics but lacks direct GraphRAG support (Source: FalkorDB content). Neo4j uses an index-free adjacency model for graph storage, which can consume more memory compared to FalkorDB's sparse adjacency matrix approach optimized for memory efficiency (Source: FalkorDB content).

Neo4j offers multitenancy and multi-database support with role-based access control and namespaces, allowing data isolation within a single instance (Source: FalkorDB content). It is built in Java/Scala and may bottleneck on complex queries at scale, whereas FalkorDB is designed for horizontal scaling and low latency (Source: FalkorDB content). Neo4j is a popular open source alternative to FalkorDB and supports the Bolt protocol experimentally in FalkorDB for migration purposes (Source: FalkorDB content).

## ArangoDB Overview and Benchmark Performance
ArangoDB is a native multi-model database supporting document, graph, and key/value data models in a single core and query language (Source: 없음). It was benchmarked against MongoDB, Neo4j, OrientDB, and PostgreSQL using a social network dataset from Pokec with 1.6 million profiles and over 30 million friendship edges (Source: content).

ArangoDB performs single document reads and writes efficiently, with aggregation over 1.6 million documents taking 1.25 seconds on average, outperforming MongoDB by a factor of 2.5 and OrientDB by a factor of 20 (Source: content). In neighbors search queries, ArangoDB is fastest at 464ms average, outperforming Neo4j and OrientDB despite being graph databases (Source: content). For shortest path queries, ArangoDB processes 40 paths in 61ms average, while MongoDB does not support shortest path queries natively (Source: content).

ArangoDB's performance advantage in aggregation is due to efficient storage of JSON documents allowing constant time access to subvalues and a fast query execution engine with batched pipelines (Source: content). Its edge index design allows constant time retrieval of adjacent edges and efficient insertion/deletion, aiding graph algorithm performance such as shortest path (Source: content). ArangoDB currently performs best when the dataset fits entirely in memory; performance degrades if the dataset exceeds available memory, with plans for improved storage engines in future releases (Source: content).

ArangoDB is the best alternative to FalkorDB, being a free and proprietary NoSQL database supporting documents, graphs, and key-values, available on Windows, Mac, and Linux (Source: ArangoDB). It is the most popular free alternative to FalkorDB and supports relational database features (Source: ArangoDB).
