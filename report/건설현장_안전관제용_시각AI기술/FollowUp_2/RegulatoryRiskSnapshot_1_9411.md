## Global Safety Challenges in the Construction Sector
The construction industry worldwide faces a critical safety challenge, with a fatality occurring approximately every nine minutes. This alarming statistic underscores the urgent need for enhanced safety measures. In the United States, construction accounts for 20% of workplace deaths despite employing just over 6% of the workforce. In 2021 alone, there were 1,015 construction-related deaths, with falls, slips, and trips causing nearly 40% of these fatalities—a 7.2% increase from 2020. Similarly, China’s construction sector remains highly dangerous, showing no significant decline in fatality rates over recent decades. Europe reports over 700 fatal construction incidents annually, equating to 13 deaths per 100,000 workers. Beyond human loss, the economic impact is substantial; occupational injuries can cost up to 3% of total project costs and 10% of labor expenses in the U.S., highlighting the financial imperative for safety improvements.

## AI Applications and Data Modalities in Construction Safety
Construction sites generate vast volumes of data primarily in text (reports, logs), visual (images, videos), and audio formats. These data streams can be leveraged by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as data mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), object recognition, and semantic segmentation to enhance safety. AI applications in construction safety focus on real-time monitoring, hazard detection, and information extraction, employing advanced methods including deep neural networks, object recognition, and NLP to emulate human cognitive functions like perception and decision-making. However, key challenges remain, including the need for high-quality, exhaustive datasets, effective semantic feature representation, and the ability to detect occluded objects in complex, dynamic construction environments. Audio-based AI applications are underexplored but present significant future research opportunities, especially with advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved text interpretation and multi-modal data integration.

## Emerging AI Technologies and Tools in Construction
AI-powered drones and robots such as MULE, Dusty, and SAM are increasingly deployed for site inspection and construction tasks, reducing human risk exposure and enhancing operational efficiency. Recent advancements in computational hardware and algorithms have enabled more effective AI applications in construction safety, facilitating real-time hazard identification and proactive safety interventions. AI-based health and safety monitoring solutions combine AI with sensors—movement detection, CCTV, heat, and weather sensors—to monitor site safety in real-time, identifying hazards like social distancing breaches, safety equipment usage, and intrusion detection. AI systems can detect improper use or absence of safety gear and unauthorized site access, enabling proactive alerts to prevent accidents without manual intervention. Integration of sensors and AI is expected to evolve towards wireless connectivity linking machines and personnel to central operating systems, further enhancing safety and operational efficiency.

## Global AI Safety Regulatory Landscape
As of early 2025, at least 69 countries have proposed over 1,000 AI-related policy initiatives and legal frameworks, reflecting a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape focused on AI safety and governance. The European Union (EU) leads with the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), enacted on August 1, 2024, establishing the world’s first comprehensive legal framework on AI. The AI Act categorizes AI systems into four risk levels: unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk, and minimal or no risk, with specific regulatory requirements for each. Unacceptable risk AI systems—such as those employing subliminal techniques, social scoring, and real-time biometric identification—are banned. High-risk AI systems, including those used in critical infrastructure safety and worker management in construction, must comply with strict obligations before market entry, including risk assessment, high-quality datasets, activity logging, human oversight, and cybersecurity standards. The AI Act also mandates transparency measures for limited risk systems and exempts minimal risk systems from regulatory requirements. Enforcement begins in 2025, with full rules phased through 2027, and fines up to €35 million or 7% of global turnover for non-compliance.

The United Kingdom adopts an activity-based, pro-innovation approach, delegating AI governance to existing sectoral regulators coordinated by central AI regulatory functions. The UK hosted the first International AI Safety Summit in 2023, elevating AI safety as a global policy priority, and has committed over £100 million to support AI regulation and innovation. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority introduced the Consumer Duty in 2024, emphasizing fair value and effective AI governance in financial services, impacting insurance pricing models. Political shifts have led to proposals for more structured AI regulation, including establishing a Regulatory Innovation Office and banning harmful AI applications.

In the United States, federal AI regulation shifted in January 2025 towards deregulation, promoting industry-led innovation and reducing federal oversight. Despite this, states actively legislate AI laws; 45 states introduced AI bills in 2024, with 31 enacting laws or resolutions. Colorado passed the first comprehensive AI law focusing on algorithmic discrimination and transparency. California vetoed a proposed AI safety bill, reflecting tensions between innovation and regulation. Other states have passed targeted laws on AI disclosure, bias mitigation, and deepfake content criminalization.

China’s AI strategy, initiated in 2017, includes sector-specific regulations and a draft AI law proposed in 2024 targeting high-risk AI systems, alongside strict content controls like mandatory watermarking to combat misinformation. China’s AI Safety Governance Framework emphasizes ethical AI development focused on safety, transparency, accountability, inclusivity, and equity. It classifies AI safety risks into inherent technology risks and application risks, prescribing technological countermeasures and comprehensive governance involving multiple stakeholders. The framework mandates role-specific safety guidelines for developers, service providers, and users, and requires monitoring of training data and AI outputs to prevent content inconsistent with China’s core socialist ideology.

Other countries such as Japan, Australia, India, UAE, and Saudi Arabia are developing AI regulatory frameworks with varying degrees of stringency, from voluntary guidelines to sector-specific licensing and ethical principles. The global AI regulatory landscape is highly fragmented, with significant variation in approaches, timelines, and enforcement mechanisms, posing challenges for organizations operating internationally, especially in high-stakes sectors like construction.

## International Coordination and Governance Efforts
International coordination efforts include the US-EU Trade and Technology Council, the G7’s Hiroshima AI process, OECD AI principles, and a proposed United Nations (UN) AI advisory body. The UN adopted a draft resolution in March 2024 titled "Seizing the opportunities of safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems for sustainable development," supported by over 120 Member States. This non-binding resolution encourages safeguarding human rights, monitoring AI risks, promoting fair and inclusive data governance, and fostering international cooperation on AI risk management. The UN’s High-level Advisory Body on AI released the "Governing AI for Humanity" report recommending initiatives such as an international scientific panel on AI, policy dialogues, AI standards exchange, capacity development networks, and a global AI fund.

## Implications for the Construction Sector
AI systems used in construction, particularly those involved in critical infrastructure management and worker safety, fall under high-risk classifications in regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act. Compliance requires pre-market conformity assessments, registration in official databases, and adherence to strict obligations including risk mitigation, transparency, human oversight, and cybersecurity. AI-powered monitoring solutions can reduce fatalities and injuries by detecting hazards, improper safety gear use, and unauthorized access in real-time, thereby lowering economic costs related to accidents and improving worker health outcomes.

The integration of multi-modal AI systems combining visual, textual, and audio data is identified as a future research priority to improve hazard detection accuracy and contextual understanding. Policy tools supporting AI adoption in construction include government-sponsored innovation sandboxes, legislation for device testing and data analysis, workforce training, and procurement policies favoring contractors experienced with AI technologies.

However, risks such as implementation challenges due to site variability, social concerns including worker privacy and job security fears, and cybersecurity threats related to sensitive real-time data collection must be managed through tailored key performance indicators, change management, training, and robust cybersecurity frameworks.

## Conclusion
