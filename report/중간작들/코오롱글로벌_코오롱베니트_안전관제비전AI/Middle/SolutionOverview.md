## Kolon Global’s 5G Specialized Network for Construction Site Safety
On July 15, 2024, Kolon Global, Sejong Telecom, and Hulan signed a business agreement to introduce Korea's first core-shared 5G specialized network model at construction sites, marking a pioneering collaboration in the construction industry. This core-shared 5G specialized network technology connects a 5G main center with multiple construction sites in real time, enabling large-scale data transmission and real-time monitoring across dispersed locations. The project is part of the '5G B2B service activation' national initiative, supported by the Ministry of Science and ICT and the Korea Intelligent Information Society Agency (NIA), highlighting government backing for smart construction technologies.

Kolon Global plans to deploy this 5G specialized network at the 5.2 million square meter construction site of Merck's bio project, demonstrating application at a large-scale, high-profile industrial site. The 5G network enables real-time AI-powered CCTV video analysis for safety monitoring, allowing proactive prevention of safety incidents through high-quality on-site video data processing. The collaboration aims to enhance construction site safety significantly by integrating AI technology with 5G communication, positioning this as a best practice for disaster prevention in construction environments. Sejong Telecom and Hulan will provide smart construction safety solutions that leverage AI and 5G specialized network communication technology, indicating a convergence of telecommunications and AI in construction safety.

Kolon Global established an integrated control center in 2022 that connects CCTVs across all domestic sites, enabling real-time monitoring and safety accident prevention activities, showing prior investment in centralized safety management. The 5G specialized network model is expected to reduce costs and improve technical security on construction sites by enabling efficient data transmission and centralized control. The signing ceremony was held at Hulan's headquarters in Yeonsu-gu, Incheon, with key executives including Kolon Global's Executive Vice President Lim Sung-gyun and Sejong Telecom's Head of Mobile Business Division Lee Kwang-mo, indicating high-level commitment. This initiative reflects a strategic move by Kolon Global to lead in smart construction safety solutions by combining advanced 5G infrastructure with AI-driven analytics, addressing critical pain points in construction site safety management. The project demonstrates a trend towards digital transformation in the construction industry, leveraging cutting-edge telecommunications and AI technologies to enhance operational safety and efficiency.

## OmniPro Vision AI: Forklift Pedestrian Collision Avoidance System
OmniPro Vision AI is an award-winning forklift pedestrian collision avoidance system designed to reduce warehouse incidents and improve safety decisions. It was recognized with the 2024 OH&S New Product of the Year Award for Facility Safety and the 2020 NIOSH Technology Innovation Award for forklift safety. Each OmniPro Vision AI camera can generate up to five fully customizable alert zones, enabling precise detection of pedestrians, equipment, and key objects without requiring tags, minimizing nuisance alerts.

The system uses advanced Vision AI cameras that are compact, IP67-rated for water and weather resistance, and built to withstand harsh, high-vibration warehouse environments. Cameras include features like Time of Flight (ToF) sensors to detect obstructions, ambient light sensors for low-light conditions, infrared cut filters, and Gorilla® Glass lens covers. OmniPro Vision AI’s Hub device centralizes connectivity for up to four cameras, featuring a built-in web UI for configuration without local software, wireless future upgrades, rugged IP67-rated design, multiple I/O connections (five digital inputs and five relay outputs), and wide operating voltage (12-48 VDC).

The system can identify pedestrians in multiple postures (standing sideways, crouching, kneeling, partial view) and those wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), enhancing detection accuracy in complex environments. OmniPro Vision AI includes a cloud-based reporting system providing 24/7 access to real-time metrics and analytics, recording zone breach incidents with time-stamped photos, pre- and post-event image capture, and trending breach analysis over time. Data is stored locally for 30 days and accessible remotely via Wi-Fi or cellular cloud continuously.

Machine integration options allow OmniPro to slow machines (Yellow Zone Alert) or deactivate the accelerator pedal (Red Zone Alert), and create speed zones in high-risk areas such as intersections and doorways to proactively prevent collisions. An optional in-cab monitor supports up to four camera feeds, automatically switching video to the device with a zone breach and providing backup camera support, enhancing operator situational awareness. The Mast Height Detector option automatically deactivates the throttle when the forklift mast is raised beyond a preset height, preventing unsafe operation conditions.

OmniPro Vision AI addresses common warehouse safety challenges including blind spots, narrow aisles, fast-paced environments, high traffic zones, shift changes, operator complacency, large containers with blind spots, inexperienced or fatigued workers, and prior pedestrian-involved incidents or serious injuries/fatalities. The system is applicable across diverse industries such as material handling/logistics, mining, quarries, construction, recycling, tunnels, airports, and public works, demonstrating broad operational versatility.
