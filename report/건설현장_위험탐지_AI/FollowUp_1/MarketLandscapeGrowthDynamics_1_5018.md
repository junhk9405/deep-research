## Introduction to AI Adoption Drivers and Inhibitors
The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in organizations is influenced by a complex interplay of business drivers and inhibitors. Recent scholarly research, including a comprehensive study synthesizing 44 academic articles and expert interviews conducted between 2020 and 2021, has identified 12 key factors that drive and 12 that inhibit the adoption of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS). This cloud-based model aims to simplify AI integration and utilization, promising significant economic benefits but also presenting unique challenges. Understanding these factors is critical for organizations seeking to leverage AI effectively and for providers tailoring AIaaS offerings.

## Drivers of AI Adoption
Among the primary drivers for AIaaS adoption is the abstraction of complexity, which allows organizations to utilize AI capabilities without deep in-house expertise. AIaaS platforms offer features such as complexity abstraction, data and model sharing, direct cloud storage linkage, and on-demand computing resources. These capabilities enable higher automation levels and access to higher-quality machine learning (ML) models, which are often pre-trained and customizable with limited data. The automation extends to automatic data preprocessing—accounting for up to 80% of the work—model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing the need for scarce and expensive AI talent. This is particularly advantageous for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that may lack extensive AI resources.

Scalability and elasticity of computing resources, including CPUs and GPUs provisioned in cloud environments, are frequently cited as critical enablers. These features allow organizations to efficiently handle fluctuating hardware demands for ML training and inference. Additionally, the multi-tenant cloud environment facilitates shared data and model capabilities, enhancing model accuracy beyond what limited in-house data could achieve.

From a theoretical perspective, the study applies Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory, categorizing drivers into dimensions such as relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, observability, and trialability. The relative advantage dimension is strongly influenced by AIaaS's automation capabilities and resource availability. Trialability is supported by provider trial periods and educational resources, which encourage experimentation and learning.

## Inhibitors to AI Adoption
Despite these drivers, several inhibitors hinder AIaaS adoption. Organizations face difficulty estimating total costs and return on investment (ROI) prior to deployment, complicating decision-making. The lack of proof-of-concept demonstrations often necessitates additional validation efforts. Deployment processes can be challenging, requiring specialized AIaaS expertise that may not be readily available.

Technical inhibitors include opaque data processing, which raises privacy concerns and complicates governance and regulatory compliance. High network latency poses challenges for real-time applications, particularly in cyber-physical systems. Integration costs and risks of provider lock-in further deter adoption, especially when significant data uploads and system integration are required. The absence of proprietary training data within organizations also limits the effectiveness of AI models.

Compatibility issues are significant, with privacy concerns and regulatory uncertainties being especially critical in sensitive sectors such as healthcare. The complexity of integrating AI developer environments and infrastructures can be daunting, particularly for organizations with legacy systems or limited AI experience. Observability challenges, such as difficulty in assessing AIaaS impact and costs before deployment, further inhibit adoption.

## Organizational and Environmental Factors
Firm size and organizational context play a pivotal role in AI adoption. Large firms tend to experience greater operating affordances of AI, enabling broader and deeper adoption due to more substantial resources and established organizational structures. They are better equipped to mitigate AI constraints but face regulatory environment challenges that can limit adoption progress. Conversely, smaller firms often exhibit lower AI readiness and weaker capabilities to overcome constraints, resulting in reduced adoption levels. Competition drives AI adoption in smaller firms, while regulatory constraints more heavily impact larger firms.

The Technological-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) framework highlights six key factors influencing AI adoption: technology affordances, technology constraints, innovation management approaches, AI readiness, competition environment, and regulatory environment. These factors interact dynamically, shaping organizational intentions and decision-making processes.

## Market Trends and Adoption Rates
The AIaaS market is rapidly expanding, with growth rates exceeding 42% in 2020, driven by major cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Salesforce, and SAP. Enterprise-scale companies show significant AI adoption, with 42% having actively deployed AI and an additional 40% exploring or experimenting with AI technologies. Momentum is increasing, as 59% of these companies have accelerated AI rollout or investments in the past two years.

Key drivers for AI adoption include advances that make AI tools easier to use, cost reduction imperatives, and increased integration of AI in off-the-shelf business applications. Common AI use cases span IT process automation, security and threat detection, AI governance, business analytics, document processing automation, and customer/employee self-service automation.

However, barriers remain substantial. Limited AI skills and expertise, data complexity, ethical concerns, high costs, lack of AI model development tools, and integration challenges are frequently cited. Generative AI adoption faces distinct inhibitors such as data privacy concerns, trust and transparency issues, and lack of implementation skills.

## Social and Ethical Considerations
Beyond technical and economic factors, social considerations significantly impact AI adoption. Fear of job losses, increased dependence on non-human agents, lack of knowledge, safety and trust issues, and absence of multi-stakeholder perspectives create resistance. Risks of bias in machine learning algorithms, influenced by human preferences, can lead to poor management decisions and broader societal issues related to trust, social inclusion, justice, ethics, and human rights.

The importance of trustworthy AI is underscored by surveys indicating that 85% of IT professionals believe consumers prefer companies with transparent and ethical AI. However, less than half of companies have implemented bias reduction, data provenance tracking, explainability, or ethical AI policies. Addressing these social considerations alongside technical and economic factors is essential to realize AI's full potential.

## Research Gaps and Emerging Trends
The literature reveals a gap between optimistic academic perspectives and practical challenges in AI adoption. Many studies focus on AI services in the Software as a Service (SaaS) model, neglecting AI developer tools and infrastructure services (Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service models). There is also a lack of systematic reviews on AI adoption in early sectors such as financial services and retail.

Emerging research areas include automated machine learning (AutoML) to reduce complexity and privacy-preserving machine learning techniques, such as trusted execution environments, to address privacy concerns. Some cloud providers, like Microsoft Azure, have begun integrating these technologies.

The rapid growth in AI-related academic publications—over 600,000 by 2018—reflects the accelerating pace of AI research and applications. Economic impact projections are substantial, with McKinsey estimating an additional $13 trillion in global GDP by 2030, and PWC forecasting AI's economic contribution could exceed the current combined output of China and India.

## Conclusion
The adoption of AI in business is driven by significant technical and economic advantages, including automation, scalability, and access to high-quality models. However, inhibitors such as cost uncertainty, technical complexity, privacy concerns, regulatory challenges, and organizational readiness must be addressed. Firm size and industry context further influence adoption dynamics.

A holistic approach that integrates technological, organizational, environmental, and social factors is essential for successful AI adoption. Providers and organizations should focus on reducing complexity, enhancing transparency, ensuring compliance, and fostering trust. Continued research and empirical validation are needed to bridge the gap between theoretical benefits and practical outcomes, enabling organizations to unlock AI's full potential.
